Start playing.】\nNow then, let's begin the training simulation for this mission.\nOur main task is to hack the enemy network and disrupt their ability to fight.\nHow...do we do that?\nDon't worry, I'll teach you!\nI didn't think there would still be anyone using a tree-shaped network structure.\nIt's precisely because such a network still exists that we have a part to play.\nMhmm...you've got a point.\nAlright, let's focus on the simulation. If we enter with this camouflage key, we can bypass the firewall and hack the enemy's control systems, allowing us to provide support for our assault teams.\nAlright, I'm trying it now.\nAll that's left after that is to crack the enemy's system defenses. We can assume direct control if they have no physical barriers in place.\nAssisting me is the best thing to do in situations like these. Give me connection access. I'll act as the mainframe and interface through a direct wired connection.\nAlright...got it.\nI'll go through your neural cloud to search for the fastest logic circuit so I can use your processing power to help with my own algorithms. Remember to grant me connection access.\nAlright, I'm coordinated with your retrieval signal. \nRight, let's begin the connection!\n......\nJust as I thought...\nHmm? What's wrong?\nAh, it's nothing. I've found the circuit. Please help me with the calculations once I find the breakpoint.\nNo problem, 40. I'll leave it to you.\n...\n45...\nHmm?\nIf the mission requires you to sacrifice yourself, would you do it?\nYes...I suppose? Besides, I can transmit my neural cloud back for reactivation.\nWhen you transmit a neural cloud, you'll lose your memories beyond the previous backup point, and your neural cloud will receive a certain amount of damage as well...\nEh...?\nAnd then...you'll become less and less like yourself... Would you do it even so?\n...I guess I would if it's an order.\nThen what if you weren't allowed to transmit your neural cloud at all, and you would have to die for real?\n......\nEven if I were to really die, I still don't think I would refuse. After all, a Doll's purpose in life is to follow orders.\n......\nIs that so...\nNo wonder they chose you...\nChose me?\nHaha, if you were to come across such a situation for real, I hope you will choose to live.\nDying for someone else's mission isn't necessarily a glorious thing...\n40...\nSorry, my mind just wandered off at a bad time. Let's continue with the hacking simulation.\n...Alright."}]
