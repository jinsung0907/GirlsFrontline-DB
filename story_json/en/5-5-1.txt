Considering how valuable she is, we have no plans of disarming her.\nInstead, we'll be using her to determine the source of her virus and prevent this from happening again.\nPlease rest assured and focus on completing Griffin's mission before she returns.\nThanks to you and the AR Team, we have another chance of locating Destroyer.\nBut just in case, we need more sources of information to confirm her coordinates.\nCommander, please lead your troops into Sangvis territory to collect more information."}]
