We've managed to extract a lot of valuable information.\nWith this, the military has expressed their interest in cooperating with us.\nThat's right, we shall soon have the chance to carry out a joint operation to fully repel Sangvis Ferri. Perhaps we may even resolve this entire conflict.\nAs for that Doll...my condolences to you. I have also known her for a long time now. I will provide you with the support you need, and wish you all the best."},{"character":["NPC-Kyruger"],"character_emotion":["0"],"speaker_name":"Kryuger","speaker":0,"text":"However, besides the rescue operation, you have something even more important right now...

Kalina should've mentioned it to you when you first joined.\nWe've fought with Sangvis Ferri for so long that this founding ideal of ours has been sidelined, but I've never forgotten...\nAnd now, it's time to end these inane days.\nOn the surface, this exercise will be a demonstration for the media, but in actuality, the military will be providing troops to help us carry out a counterattack on Sangvis Ferri.\nI'm sure you're aware that with the might of the military, it should take no longer than three days.\nI hope that you will command our forces during this operation as you've been at the forefront of the Sangvis Ferri resistance, and as such, you are the most qualified to do so."}]
