The higher the score, the more we can collect from Griffin. \nMaintaining the defensive line gives you more points, so please defend yourselves against the enemy. \nSince the Dolls are all retreating in different directions, the gathering point will change position after a fixed amount of time, so please pay attention to changes on your map.\nAccording to our predictions, Sangvis Ringleaders from other areas might take part in the assault as well. It is entirely your call whether to engage them or not. \nGriffin has asked us to hold out for 15 rounds, so please try to score as high as possible during that time. Good luck!"},{"character":[""],"character_emotion":[""],"speaker_name":"","speaker":0,"bg":"10","text":""}]
