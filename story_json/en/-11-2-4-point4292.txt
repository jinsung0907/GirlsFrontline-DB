Start playing.】\nWanna try setting up a connection? \nC-Connection? \nHeheh, we're the same model. Our ports can be directly linked so I can send you my combat data. \nThen...thank you. But my storage space... \nIt's fine! I've already compressed them into a size that you can handle. \nThat's perfect... But I still feel a bit iffy about the connection... \nHuh? What's there to worry about? It's not dangerous. \nI've only ever used the Zener Network for file transfer... This is the first time I've ever established a cable link... I don't know what's gonna happen... \nIt's actually not that different, and no one else can read our data exchange so it's very safe! \nR-Really...? \nThere. I've sent the data. Try using it in your simulation training! \nSure...and thanks so much! \nHaha, don't mention it. Oh right, let me show you something else. \nHuh? What? \nHeheh, photos I took secretly using the viewfinding authorization when I was out on a mission. \nThis is...? \nOh wow... This is gorgeous... \nSadly I won't ever get to take pictures like these out there... \nDon't worry. You WILL get your own assignments some day. I'll show you how to access this function. \nBut...isn't it bad to do things without orders...?\nIt doesn't matter. They're just for myself. You don't have to ask for the commander's permission for everything. Remember, even T-Dolls have the right to do what they want! \nHmm...you have a point... \nThen that's a promise!"}]
