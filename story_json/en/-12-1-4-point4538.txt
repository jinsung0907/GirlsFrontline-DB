Start playing.】\nBy the way, looks like we're gonna be assigned to a combat squad. \nHuh? We can see real action so soon? But I don't think I'm ready yet... \nHasn't your accuracy gone up to 60% already? \nThat's all thanks to you, 40. \nHahaha, you're right. I'm the best teacher there is! \nOf course I'm happy that they're sending me on missions, but that could be dangerous. We'll be fighting with live rounds, after all... \nIt'll be fine! I'm not particularly strong, but I'll do everything to protect you if you're ever in danger! \nReally? \nHaha, of course! I'm sure you'll do the same if I'm in danger, right? \nYeah, that's right... I'll also protect you, 40! \nThough it's more likely that we'll both end up getting killed... Our fault for being so weak, hahaha... \nGetting killed together...doesn't sound so bad. \nHuh? \nIf the neural cloud is intact, we may get a new body! \nA new...body? \nYeah, then we'll no longer be held back by our own body, and no one will ever look down on us again! \nOooooh! You're right! That'll be awesome! \nStill...we aren't advanced T-Dolls so the commander probably won't be bothered to get us new bodies. \nWell, it doesn't hurt to dream. If we somehow do something worthy of recognition out there, that'll show them, right? Then surely we can request for new bodies, hmm? \nYeah...we can do it. \nGreat! Then it's decided. One day, we'll accomplish a mission that's impossible for anyone else! Then we'll get the best bodies they could possibly build, and no one will ever look down on us again!"}]
