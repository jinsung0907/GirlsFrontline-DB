Are you ready?"},{"character":["NPC-Seele","UMP45"],"character_emotion":["0","2"],"speaker_name":"UMP45","speaker":1,"text":"I'm in a bad mood. Be concise."},{"character":["NPC-Seele","UMP45"],"character_emotion":["0","2"],"speaker_name":"Zeele","speaker":0,"text":"As you wish. Miss Persica wants Squad 404 to head deep into the heart of Sangvis territory in Area S15 to retrieve a small drone shot down by Sangvis Ferri. \nSince the area is badly contaminated as well as heavily fortified, you're to locate the drone with the help of your new electronic signals. \nThrough the use of the new electronic warfare module, you can harness the computational capacity of other T-Dolls to boost the efficiency of your analog signals within the Zener Network."},{"character":["NPC-Seele","UMP45"],"character_emotion":["0","2"],"speaker_name":"UMP45","speaker":1,"text":"So that's the purpose of the module we installed... \nDid Miss Persica give any detail on the importance of this drone?"},{"character":["NPC-Seele","UMP45"],"character_emotion":["0","2"],"speaker_name":"Zeele","speaker":0,"text":"Though the drone was shot down, its connection to the network is still stable, so you can locate it with your new module. \nMiss Persica mentioned that this particular drone is of vital importance and must be recovered at all costs. \nAs for why, she didn't say..."},{"character":["NPC-Seele","UMP45"],"character_emotion":["0","2"],"speaker_name":"UMP45","speaker":1,"text":"You mean she didn't want to say. Not that I need to know. \nI don't like people donating us random weird modules, but the price Persica named is way too high... \nSo high I don't want to imagine what would happen if I had refused."},{"character":["NPC-Seele","UMP45"],"character_emotion":["0","2"],"speaker_name":"Zeele","speaker":0,"text":"Don't worry too much. All that matters is the reward, right?"},{"character":["NPC-Seele","UMP45"],"character_emotion":["0","2"],"speaker_name":"UMP45","speaker":1,"text":"I don't deny it, though I wonder how much I can actually get. \nI don't understand why \"that person\" would take such a big share just to repair some piece of junk... \nWell, that's enough grumbling. I bet Persica can't wait to hear about our latest training results?"},{"character":["NPC-Seele","UMP45"],"character_emotion":["0","2"],"speaker_name":"Zeele","speaker":0,"text":"Yes, but it's more important to her that you can accomplish the mission without undue risks. \nSo please proceed to the next training soon."},{"character":["NPC-Seele","UMP45"],"character_emotion":["0","2"],"speaker_name":"Zeele","speaker":0,"text":"When it comes to the actual battle, Sangvis Ferri will very likely attempt to destroy the data stored in the drone through the network. \nYou'll need stronger allies in bigger numbers on your side. Miss Persica knows very well how important this is. \nShe has enlisted the help of all off-duty T-Dolls under the commander in Area S09 and directed their computational capacity to the signals of Squad 404. With that, you can make use of other echelons in cyberspace."},{"character":["NPC-Seele","UMP45"],"character_emotion":["0","2"],"speaker_name":"UMP45","speaker":1,"text":"That will get us through most obstacles. \nZeele, get the other three and connect us to the network.

I just ran a diagnostic on your hardware and neural cloud. Everything is functioning normally. \nStill, there can sometimes be inconceivable conflicts among modules, and judging from current observations, they don't seem to be too detrimental, so I think it's not actually a big problem. \nI've already asked Deele to adjust the parameters of your neural cloud, and I'll keep monitoring your electroneuralography."},{"character":["NPC-Seele","UMP45"],"character_emotion":["0","2"],"speaker_name":"UMP45","speaker":1,"text":"Conflicting modules...
