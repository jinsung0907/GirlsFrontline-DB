Thank you very much!\nI had thought…I would not be able to complete the mission… I am so weak and small… I cannot do anything.\nBut thanks to your constant protection along the way, I was able to carry out my duty.\nWe now have one final task. I must deliver the reports to Miss Helian.\nIn order to avoid Sangvis' detection and make it in time for her conference with the reconstruction contractors, please accompany me one last time.\nLet us do our best together on our final mission, Commander."}]
