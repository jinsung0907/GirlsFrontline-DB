The situation is identical to the last Parapluie attack.\nAt the same time, a large number of Sangvis units have suddenly emerged within Area S05 and are moving to the detention center.\nBut we can't take the risk of storming the building at the moment, so we can only count on the defense system and our T-Dolls inside.\nYour priority is to destroy the Sangvis troops on the outside to alleviate the pressure faced by those within the detention center.\nPlease mobilize as quickly as you can and try your best to stop the enemy from surging into the building!"}]
