This is RO with a mid-mission report. The operation is proceeding smoothly, I think...\nIt's just that SOP II's efficiency is still a little low... I suspect her emotions are negatively impacting her reactions.\nThat's right... She has noticed it herself, but the situation is worse than she thinks...\nFor the past hour, her responses to my orders have been slower by an average of 1.3 seconds.\nHer processing speed is still within an acceptable margin, but she occasionally zones out while resting. It seems that her concentration has waned as well.\nI don't know why, but I have a feeling that she is keeping something from me.\nThe search operation for M16 relies on SOP II's experience, and we only have one last area to search.\nHowever, it's not just SOP II. I probably need some rest as well since we've been working for 20 hours straight. It's been a bit stressful, not because of the mission, but rather it's that...I've been thinking about too many unnecessary things... \nHow strange, I'm clearly just a T-Doll...\nI'll end the report here for now.
