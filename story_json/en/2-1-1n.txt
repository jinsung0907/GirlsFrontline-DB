You're right on time.\nAs indicated on the map, Sangvis troops have already set up a defence line in the area.\nTo coordinate with the military's operation to eradicate them, we need to clandestinely station some men in a few bases.\nInfiltration requires the use of brains. We're planning to leave it to a pro like you.\nYou're in great demand at Griffin these days, y'know? It took quite some effort just to borrow you.\nSo do your best, Boss. Everyone's counting on you."}]
