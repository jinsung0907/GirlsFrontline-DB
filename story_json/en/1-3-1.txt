I hope you're ready, Commander.\nOur frontlines have retrieved several injured T-Dolls that are in urgent need of repair once they're transported back to base.\nBut intel shows that a Sangvis outpost is still operating autonomously under minimal command along our transport route.\nThey don't actually pose much threat to us, but these injured T-Dolls are very important to us, and there must be no room for mistakes.\nSo if you'd please dispose of that outpost quickly to ensure our T-Dolls' safe return."}]
