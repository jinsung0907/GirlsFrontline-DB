Listen carefully.\nA friendly T-Doll designated VZ-61 has gone missing and is suspected to have fallen into Sangvis hands.\nShe may be in possession of important intelligence, so we must recover her.\nOur most pressing objective is to locate this T-Doll and launch a rescue mission.\nAnd your job, Commander, is to scour the Sangvis command post in the area for valuable operation records.\nOne more thing, Commander.\nUnlike those at the previous outpost, these Sangvis troops will actively seek out and attack our forces. Please be careful."}]
