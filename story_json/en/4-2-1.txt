The situation isn't looking very good.\nThe team has identified the local Sangvis Ringleader as 'Intruder'.\nShe seems to be a new model as there is no other information about her in Sangvis Ferri's old product catalogue.\nBut from what we've learned in our investigation, unlike previous T-Dolls that are suited for solo combat, this one specializes in issuing commands.\nBlock the route on the side. We must do whatever we can to undermine her defensive maneuvers.\nThat's the only way to intercept Sangvis reinforcement and prevent them from pouring into the battlefield."}]
