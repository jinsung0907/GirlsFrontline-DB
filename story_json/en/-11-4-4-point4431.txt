You'll be transferred elsewhere. \nW...what...? Are you serious?! Why?! \nYou know the rules... Disobeying direct orders. Assaulting friendly units. Either of these is enough to have you executed. \nI just want to go where I want. How is that wrong?! \nWe are Tactical Dolls. It's not our place to decide where we want to go. \nYou must be joking! Just because I don't want to babysit that rubbish Doll?! This kind of ridiculous mission— \nSLAP! 【The sound of a smack on the face.】\nWake up. \n... \nYou're not some elite T-Doll. You're just a pathetic creature living in your own delusional world. \nWhat are you talking about...? \nGriffin will pick you up in six hours. Pack your things. \n... \nSLAM!  【The sound of a door slammed shut.】\nHaha... I'm sorry you had to watch that. \nDon't be. It must be hard on you saying that to her face. \nHaha... It wasn't so bad. The next mission is gonna be very dangerous. It's probably a good thing for her to leave. \nBut she could have her core removed sitting out this mission. \nThat's true... But even that's better than just dying without a word. Compared to that, I'm more worried about you. Please apologize to 45 on my behalf. \nSure thing! Thanks for your concern, and I'll be sure to relay your message. I look forward to working with you!"}]
