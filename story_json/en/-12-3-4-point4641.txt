Let's switch protocols.\nAlright, I'm copying the OGAS circuit. The pathway logic is synced to my neural cloud.\nBeginning duplication using OGAS logic. Huh...S.F.'s access circuits are surprisingly easy to enter.\nSo, what do you think? This is something that other Dolls can't do.\nHeh, I feel quite...quite pleased.\nBecause you're with me?\nNo, because I'm helping everyone... Of course, I'm happy to be with you too, 40!\nHaha, I'm just kidding. Don't worry about it.\n40, completing this mission would count as a great accomplishment, right? I wonder if they'll allow us to switch to good bodies when we get back.\nThis is just the beginning. What comes next is where the fun begins.\nFun?\nHaha...that's right. That's the way it is. Of course it is...\nYou sound...kind of weird...\n45...do you trust me?\nOf course, I've always trusted you.\nThen...if you trust me, grant me total access to your neural cloud once we connect.\nHuh...?\nAfter we connect, no matter what happens, don't make a sound.
