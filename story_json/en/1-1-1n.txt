Please allow me to brief you on this operation.\nAfter Griffin had reclaimed Area S09, Internal Affairs planned to convert it into human settlement.\nBut just as the reconstruction began, our scouts suddenly reported that a vast number of Sangvis troops were stationed some distance away.\nWe need more exact information on our enemies as evidence for Miss Helian to negotiate with the construction contractor.\nTo that end, we need a T-Doll to check in with the others and acquire the newest reconnaissance report.\nShe's already in position, Commander. I'll let her say hello."},{"character":["MP5"],"character_emotion":["0"],"speaker":0,"speaker_name":"Gr MP5","bg":"10","text":"G-Greetings. I am MP5 of Griffin.\nUm... I believe you are the commander who reclaimed Area S09? It is an honor to meet you.\nNow, to avoid alerting the enemy, we will be operating under the cover of night.\nNight vision goggles would be a great help, and armor-piercing bullets would also be very effective against armored units.\nPlease guide me to the rendezvous point with the first T-Doll scout when you finish your preparation."}]
