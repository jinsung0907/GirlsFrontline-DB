Now playing.】\nWhat...is this place? \nThe Ministry of National Security. \nLooks like we've been temporarily assigned here for the operation... \nNervous? We're in an unfamiliar environment after all. \nHmm... everything feels so harsh and cold here, though it's not really that different from Griffin... \nHaha, but then again this is so much more luxurious. Oh, hold on. I'm receiving new directives. \nAh, commander, here you are. \nConnect to ports #3, #5 and #18 for identity authentication. \nRoger. Identity authenticated. \nHQ has ordered the two of you to delete all operation records from your time in Griffin. \nHuh...? Is that really necessary? \nShush, 45... \nThat's an order. Do it at once. \nYes, sir. \nYes, sir... \nSecond directive, you are to install the confidentiality safeguard program issued by the Ministry. The file has just been sent to you via port #18. \nRoger. Installing. \nAfter all Griffin authorizations have been purged, redirect your command authorization to me. \nYes, sir. Applying for the security certificate from Griffin. ETA in 30 minutes. \nEverything is so clunky with Griffin tech... Report to the training room after you're done. Unauthorized connections are prohibited here, and all communications must be made verbally. \nUnderstood, Commander. See you later. \nHe's gone... Confidentiality safeguard program? I have a bad feeling about this... Have you ever heard of such a thing? \nTo prevent a leak, it can seal off and even delete a T-Doll's memory. Under extreme circumstances...it can also completely fry the neural cloud. \nThat...scary? \nIt's for the sake of keeping their intelligence safe... It can't be helped if the mission really does call for it. \nBy the way, only I have to redirect the command authorization to the new commander. We'll then share the authorization. \nWhat do you mean? \nYou redirect yours to me, so you won't answer directly to the commander. We can then set up an internal link to communicate our orders. \nHuh? But then...I'll be without a commander. \nThey probably won't be sending us on tough missions anyway. This will also save you some space. \nI don't personally have a problem with this, but what about the commander? \nDon't worry about it. This is to ensure better performance. I'll explain it to him. \nOkay... I trust you."}]
