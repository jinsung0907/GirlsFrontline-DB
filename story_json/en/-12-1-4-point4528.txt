Elite T-Dolls really are different. \nHaha, we just have to support them. \nIf only we had such well-built bodies... \nDon't dwell on such things. We are crucial to the mission too! \nOh, they're looking this way... \nHey, are you from Backup Squad 14? \nYes. \nHmm... UMP40 and UMP45, if I remember correctly? \nHeheh, that's right! \nYou remember...our designation... \nHaha, I remember every single member on the team. Not to mention you're pretty famous. \nM16A1, what are you doing? \nHuh? Just chatting. \nWhat's the point in chatting with T-Dolls like them? \nDon't say that. Every T-Doll on the frontline has something to contribute to the effort. Who knows? They might just end up saving your life at some point. \nSaving my life? We can simply backup our neural clouds. True pros won't hesitate making sacrifices. \nHaha, what an extremist. Still, best not take any bullets if you can help it, eh? \nSorry about that.
