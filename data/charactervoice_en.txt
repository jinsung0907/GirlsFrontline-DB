Grizzly|DIALOGUE1|You can't just sit all day, Commander. Fancy a drive with me?
Grizzly|DIALOGUE2|Don't get the wrong idea, okay?
Grizzly|DIALOGUE3|Don't rely on me too much, Commander. You can do perfectly fine on your own...
Grizzly|Wedding|Oh? Do you want something from me, Commander?<>Huh? Are you kidding?! I think of you as a friend, but you...you wanna...<>Not that I hate it, but at least give me...some time to prepare...
Grizzly|Introduce|Oh? Why if it isn't the Commander. Grizzly MkV, I'll be tagging along from now on.
Grizzly|ALLHALLOWS|What's the plan tonight, Commander? ...Oh? Whose apple cider is this? I'm helping myself!

M9|DIALOGUE1|M1911 seems to hate me. I really wanna get along with her.
M9|DIALOGUE2|My rank climbed again in the popularity poll! I'm so happy!
M9|DIALOGUE3|Uh... So sleepy... Let me take a nap...
M9|Wedding|Commander... So you do think I'm the most glittery and charming?<>No? Really? Ah, I get it now! Let's shine together then!
M9|Introduce|M9 here! I'm super popular!
M9|ALLHALLOWS|Halloween is the best! I can get so much candy!
M9|DIALOGUEWEDDING|You're all glittery today, Commander. It is, of course, all thanks to me. Praise me!
C96|DIALOGUE1|My clothes. Are they cute?
C96|DIALOGUE2|You see my belly button? Heheh...
C96|DIALOGUE3|Uh... It's so stuffy. Guess I'll take it off...
C96|Wedding|Huhhhh? Whyyyyyy?<>Is it 'cause I'm smart? Cute? Unusual? Or is it because I have a long history? Or...or... Fine...<>I'll just keep guessing right here by your side.
C96|Introduce|You're my Commander, aren't you?
C96|ALLHALLOWS|What should I dress as for the masquerade tonight? Heheheh. How about an apron with a pumpkin mask? Huh? What do you mean 'tasteless', Commander?
C96|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Am I too noisy, Commander? Am I bothering you? ...Okay, I'll be quiet as a mouse till you get off work!
92type|DIALOGUE1|Please leave it to me to take stock of our resources, Commander.
92type|DIALOGUE2|Is that a new order? Apologies, I didn't hear you just now.
92type|DIALOGUE3|Be careful with your hands. We don't want any accidental discharge, do we?
92type|Wedding|What do you see in me, Commander? Hmm, so can I keep being frugal?<>Then I'll be managing our family budget from now on.
92type|Introduce|Type 92, reporting in! Which squad am I being assigned to?
92type|ALLHALLOWS|It's tonight... Preparing candy is too much trouble. I'll just get them from someone... Hmm, her it is.
92type|DIALOGUEWEDDING|You still haven't gone over budget, Commander. Well done for this month. I'll look the other way about your little coffer.
357|DIALOGUE1|I'm hungry...
357|DIALOGUE2|Dessert sounds good, but some meat would be great.
357|DIALOGUE3|Why do girls have bigger breasts than boys?
357|Wedding|Huh? Bringing that up so suddenly, Commander... You mean it?<>Yes! Of course I will! Today is my happy day!<>Can I give you a hug?
357|Introduce|I'll be in your care from now on!
357|ALLHALLOWS|What should I do, Commander... I just ate FF FNC's snacks by accident and now she's crying... *Sobs* I'm sorry...
357|DIALOGUEWEDDING|You didn't finish your story last time, Commander. Come to my room some time and tell me the rest!

Glock17|Wedding|You have an odd look on your face, Boss... What? Hold on a second! Why me? Well...I'm just a little bit pleased. Heheh, I'll be by your side, observing you from now on.
Glock17|Introduce|G17, reporting! Hey...at least smile a little huh?
Glock17|ALLHALLOWS|Halloween, eh? Let me tell you, Boss...who only wants to dress up, and who actually wants to scare you out of your skin.

FNP9|DIALOGUE1|What's there to do today apart from lessons, Commander?
FNP9|DIALOGUE2|I have many different uniforms. This one looks pretty cute too.
FNP9|DIALOGUE3|I know I'm terribly charming, Commander, but please stop staring at me. It's embarrassing.
FNP9|Wedding|You sure about choosing me, Commander? It's because of my smile, isn't it? I do have an incomparable smile, I know. I'll keep working hard with a smile from now on. Heheh... I'm so happy...
FNP9|Introduce|It's time for FF FNP9's...gorgeous...debut! Commander...please give me...your support from now on...

FMG9|DIALOGUE1|Please check the newest intelligence collected today, Boss.
FMG9|DIALOGUE2|I wish...people would know me better.
FMG9|DIALOGUE3|My disguise isn't a form of cosplaying. It's not for show, okay?
FMG9|Wedding|I'd thought nobody really understood me... From now on, Boss, I'll be your exclusive informant! I'm so happy to have met you.
FMG9|Introduce|FMG-9 is under your command now, boss. There's no cause for alarm, I'm not in my firing mode at the moment.
FMG9|ALLHALLOWS|The festivities tonight aren't challenging in the slightest for a master of disguise like me. But I did enjoy myself.
FMG9|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Boss, they've invited me to a weekend meet-up. What should I wear? ...Get real. This is serious...
M3|DIALOGUE1|G-Grease Gun?! You can't be talking about me, right?
M3|DIALOGUE2|My firing velocity isn't good enough? Can't be helped because of the production cost...
M3|DIALOGUE3|Still...no paycheck, Commander? Things are gonna get tough this month...
M3|Wedding|What is it, Commander? Is this another prank?<>Huh? What's...this? C-Can I really have this?<>Really...? I'm...so glad...
M3|Introduce|He-hello, I'm...M3...p-pleased to make your acquaintance.

IDW|DIALOGUE3|Up a bit! Yes, yes, right there! Thanks Commeownder!
IDW|Wedding|What? Really?<>All I wanted...was a home. I never thought about having you all to meowself!<>But if that's what you want, Commeownder... I'm helping meowself!
IDW|Introduce|IDW meow! Could you please take me in and adopt me, Commeownder? Eh, you will!? I'm so happy!
IDW|ALLHALLOWS|Ugh... It's pretty chilly tonight... I-I'm not very good with this because there are too meowny creepy stories where I'm from!
IDW|DIALOGUEWEDDING|How's the weather outside, Commeownder? Let's go sunbathing! It's this time of the day that I always look forward to!
64type|DIALOGUE1|Go outside? I'd rather stay here.
64type|DIALOGUE2|Since you're in, Commander, shall I brew more tea?
64type|DIALOGUE3|Please refrain from making too much noise, Commander. Silence is golden.
64type|Wedding|Me...? Is this really a good idea, Commander?<>There are better choices... No, I'm happy!<>I'll brew tea for you for the rest of our lives.
64type|Introduce|Type64 reporting. Commander, I'm honored to be able to learn from you.
64type|ALLHALLOWS|Oh, who's outside the door? It's Halloween...? The candy isn't ready yet... Will green tea ice cream do?
64type|DIALOGUEWEDDING|How's the tea, Commander? And I recommend this book - it goes very well with this tea. This is my secret way of relaxing.
98K|DIALOGUE1|You can come visit me in my room every now and then if you want, heheh...
98K|DIALOGUE2|Don't do such outrageous things, Commander. You'll upset the other girls...
98K|DIALOGUE3|I'm studying battle tactics right now. Have you been taking care of your duties, too, Commander?

98K|ALLHALLOWS|Halloween, eh? Heh, trick or treat, Commander!
98K|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Don't work all the time. Spend some time chatting with me...about whatever. Perhaps your whereabouts in the last few days, heheh...
M1|DIALOGUE1|Aren't you greedy, Commander? Heheh...
M1|DIALOGUE2|Thank you for taking such good care of me, Commander.
M1|DIALOGUE3|Seriously... Your work isn't finished for today. Don't play with the other girls yet.
M1|Wedding|I'm simply too tired today, Commander. I'd really put in all I've got, but somehow I just wasn't very efficient... I'm so sorry!<>Hmm? What did you say... Me? ...Why?
M1|Introduce|M1 Garand. I will fight under your command from now on, Commander.
M1|ALLHALLOWS|I'm not a child anymore, but I guess I'll still keep the candy.
M1|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Tell me if you need anything, Commander. I'm always ready. You can't do without me by your side.
M14|DIALOGUE1|You...touched me just now, didn't you? You totally did!
M14|DIALOGUE2|Victory. This word just has a nice ring to it, right?♪
M14|DIALOGUE3|C'mon! Be prepared, and victory shall be ours!
M14|Wedding|This day is finally here, Commander.<>I've always been wondering when you'd notice me...<>This is the happiest of my entire life!

M14|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, Commander! Wanna hear a joke? It's a bit embarrassing, but...you're used to it, right? Heheh...
M14|CHRISTMAS|Merry Christmas! Santa Claus is coming, right? RIGHT?
M21|DIALOGUE1|What is it, Commander? Want me...to tell a joke?
M21|DIALOGUE2|I, for one...like things lively.
M21|DIALOGUE3|What a killjoy. Not even an eyebrow raised...? But I suppose that's what makes you a Commander.
M21|Wedding|Now, of all times...I can't come up with any puns. Funny isn't it?<>In the end, one can't picture the future if they keep clinging to the past, right?<>But thank you very much, Commander.
M21|Introduce|Hello! It's M21! Just because I'm a sniper rifle, doesn't mean I have to have a gloomy personality, right?!
M21|ALLHALLOWS|Halloween? It's...not really my forte. After all, pranks are quite different from my usual jokes, right?
M21|DIALOGUEWEDDING|So...that's the end. What do you think of this story, Commander? Will they like it? I only trust your taste.
M21|CHRISTMAS|Merry Christmas, Commander! I was invited to the Santa Claus hunt, but I've decided to stay cozy here at home after all!
88type|HELLO|Ah, Master, welcome back!
88type|SKILL2|I can't just give you my number!
88type|SKILL3|What a boorish customer. You'd better make yourself scarce!
88type|DIALOGUE1|Will it be hot these few days? But it's not a big deal for me.
88type|DIALOGUE2|Don't miss the news about this year's ComiAi. Here's a poster, please treasure it.
88type|DIALOGUE3|Non~ Non~ Like I've said, this isn't cosplay! Being a maid is also a proper job!
88type|Wedding|So what would you like this time, Master?<>Huhhh? Me...? A-Alright. But make sure you take good care of me...<>Umm... So this time, I'm yours.
88type|Introduce|Welcome to the CA club! Hanyang Type 88, it's a pleasure to be of service to you, master.

G43|DIALOGUE1|Are the tactical preparations ready?
G43|DIALOGUE2|Ah, it's nothing... Heheh...
G43|DIALOGUE3|Commander, it's not like you can't touch me, but don't pull any sneak attacks!
G43|Wedding|Will you still choose me no matter how I look, Commander? ...Danke schön. Then let me stay by your side from now on. I shall enjoy the music of your voice and keep growing.
G43|Introduce|Guten tag! I am G43, please allow me to display my elegance in battle from this day forward.
G43|ALLHALLOWS|Süßes oder Saure! It's all good as long as the kids have fun!

FN49|DIALOGUE1|Don't touch me in funny places.
FN49|DIALOGUE2|P-Please don't tease me.
FN49|DIALOGUE3|Hey! Even I'll get mad...
FN49|Wedding|Eh?! What's this that you have given me! Can I really? However, since I'm the one Commander has chosen, I won't let it go to any other! Please allow me to stay by your side, ever growing stronger!
FN49|Introduce|P-p-p-p-pleased to to meet you...
FN49|ALLHALLOWS|Y-You're giving my candy? Thank you...

BM59|DIALOGUE1|How do I look today, Commander? Pretty as ever?
BM59|DIALOGUE2|I want to look...even more radiant...
BM59|DIALOGUE3|Yeah, I know. Inner beauty matters too.
BM59|Wedding|I've always wanted to remain true to myself, and for you to notice me. My wish has finally come true.<>Please keep being my Commander from here on out, okay?
BM59|Introduce|VM59, reporting in. Having been through numerous upgrades, Commander, I will definitely not let you down.
BM59|ALLHALLOWS|Only in an evening like this can I think about nothing and just doll myself up. Care to pick a dress for me, Commander?
BM59|DIALOGUEWEDDING|You like my accessories today, Commander? Training goes without saying, but I can't slack off in grooming either...since what I do reflect on you.
G41|DIALOGUE1|Is there anything you'd like to do, Master?
G41|DIALOGUE2|Master, I want to hear more of your stories!
G41|DIALOGUE3|Could you pat me on the head? That makes me happy!
G41|Wedding|I was worried that you might hate me...<>But that concern was unncessary.<>I, Gr G41, will be forever by your side, Master!
G41|Introduce|Gr G41. Master, please take me home!
G41|ALLHALLOWS|Trick or Treat! Tee-hee, I won't actually trick you since you're busy. But I'll still take the treat.
G41|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Master, many interesting things happened today! Listen in, and give me treats if you like the story!
HK416|DIALOGUE1|Commander, I am all you need.
HK416|DIALOGUE2|HKM4? I have no need for such a name anymore!
HK416|DIALOGUE3|Be careful with the inspection. Don't let any problem pass, no matter how trivial.
HK416|Wedding|Be it you or achievements in combat, everything is mine.<>You don't have to raise a finger, Commander. I'll settle everything for you.
HK416|Introduce|416...Please remember this name, Commander.
HK416|ALLHALLOWS|Ghosts? I wouldn't codename an operation 'Ghost' if I were afraid of such things, would I?
HK416|DIALOGUEWEDDING|How have you been doing these days, Commander? If you're feeling down, I'll make you smile by any means necessary... You got a better idea? Let's hear it.
HK416|BREAK|Just...what am I missing?! I should’ve done everything perfectly! 
HK416|FIX|Ugh... I really hope...they’ll never see me like this...
HK416|RETREAT|I hate this... I should be fit to fight in any terrain.

FNFAL|DIALOGUE1|Did you forget anything? ...Just don't forget about me.
FNFAL|DIALOGUE2|The tea today is not bad. Then, what about today's chocolate?
FNFAL|DIALOGUE3|Gosh, Commander! Someone like you should be more serious!
FNFAL|Wedding|Today is a big day, but no need to be so nervous.<>Relax. Just do what you have to do, now and always. <>That's what it is to be the Commander, right? There's no way I can be wrong about this.
FNFAL|Introduce|Well then, you're the Commander, huh? Well, make sure you don't let me down.
FNFAL|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Your clothes are all mussed again. You're not alone anymore, so please be more aware of your own responsibilities. Here, let me fix you up.
FNFAL|CHRISTMAS|Happy Christmas, Commander... Please end the ball soon. It feels a bit chilly...wearing this gown all night...
FNFAL|VALENTINE|Tonight, we shall have flowers, sports cars and a noble feast. I will make FF FN49 green with envy.
M16A1|DIALOGUE1|What's my thing? Jack Daniels, for sure.
M16A1|DIALOGUE2|I don't mind you messing with me, Commander, but don't touch my sister.
M16A1|DIALOGUE3|One eye is more than enough. I'm a crack shot, after all.
M16A1|Wedding|Oh? So you finally notice my merits, Commander?<>But...uh...you're getting too close. This needs some getting used to.<>In any case, should I tell M4 about this?
M16A1|Introduce|Yo. It's me, M16A1. Leave the mission to me.
M16A1|ALLHALLOWS|Oh, so that's what Halloween started off as. Bit of a shame that it isn't a festival for drinking.
M16A1|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Let's have a drink after working, Commander. But, don't tell M4 this time, or it's me who gets the tongue lashing.
M4A1|DIALOGUE1|Yes, Commander...
M4A1|DIALOGUE2|That...tickles a bit...
M4A1|DIALOGUE3|...
M4A1|Wedding|Commander... It is an honor to fight for your sake.<>Umm...do you understand what I am getting at? Please allow me to stay by your side from now on...
M4A1|Introduce|Commander, I'll be...in your care.
M4A1|ALLHALLOWS|M1 Garand is surrounded by quite a crowd tonight. I wonder what is going on... I had better go have a look.
M4A1|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Here is the operation plan for today, Commander. As always, I have complete faith in your judgment. Let us lead everyone to victory.
M4 SOPMOD II|DIALOGUE1|Commander, what are we gonna play this time?
M4 SOPMOD II|DIALOGUE2|What is it? Let me take a look too!
M4 SOPMOD II|DIALOGUE3|You can do anything you like, but if you touch me in weird places, I might just flip a switch or something...
M4 SOPMOD II|Wedding|Heheheh... I've been waiting for a long time. Now that you've finally said it, you're a comrade-in-arms for real! So...give me a hug?
M4 SOPMOD II|Introduce|M4 SOPMOD II. I've finally found you, Commander!
M4 SOPMOD II|ALLHALLOWS|Treat or Trick, Commander! I'm dressing as Leatherface tonight! Honey, if you don't give me candies, then...heheheh...
M4 SOPMOD II|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, what do you think of my new masterpiece? It was hard work collecting and assembling the parts, we had lots of fun! Tee-hee...
AR15|DIALOGUE1|I wonder when it will be my turn...
AR15|DIALOGUE2|What you are looking at, Commander? N-Not the trademark, right?
AR15|DIALOGUE3|If you think you can do this to me just because I'm a commercial model... Please stop it before I get angry for real.
AR15|Wedding|Commander, is this a dream?<>Please let me stay by your side... I don't want to wake up.
AR15|Introduce|ST AR-15. Please allow me to formally join this honorable squad and watch me as I bring you victory.
AR15|ALLHALLOWS|Hmm... If I may, I'd like to give out candies. Would you like the hard or chewy ones, Commander?
AR15|DIALOGUEWEDDING|How was my performance today, Commander? We're another step closer to reaching our own goals, and some day, we'll get there.
ASVAL|DIALOGUE1|Huh? Me?
ASVAL|DIALOGUE2|Please leave me alone.

ASVAL|Introduce|Hello, I...eh? Nevermind...
ASVAL|ALLHALLOWS|Halloween...isn't really my thing...
ASVAL|DIALOGUEWEDDING|May I bring my friend with us the next time we have a holiday, Commander? We all had fun last time, don't you think?
G36|DIALOGUE1|Feel free to let me know if there is any problem.
G36|DIALOGUE2|How about a second helping, Master? There are freshly fried sausages.
G36|DIALOGUE3|It is my duty to answer my master's needs.
G36|Wedding|I have only been able to give my all because you need me, Master.<>From now on, please let me stay by your side as your bespoke maid.
G36|Introduce|Guten tag. I will exclusively serve as your maid from now on, master.
G36|ALLHALLOWS|Commander, you shouldn't be spoiling everyone so much. You've given out too much candies tonight. They might not be able to go into battle if they get cavities.
G36|DIALOGUEWEDDING|It's going to be another busy day today, yet you're the only one that knows how hardworking I am... So, is there anything you'd like me to get for you? I'll continue to keep this a secret from everyone.

FNFNC|DIALOGUE1|Commander, hurry up and give me some desserts! Gimme! Gimme! Gimme~!
FNFNC|DIALOGUE2|I heard Japanese desserts are very tasty. Things like daifuku and raw yatsuhashi...I want to try them!
FNFNC|DIALOGUE3|Will I get fat if I keep eating? ...I'll be alright. Eating is a part of my nature afterall!
FNFNC|Wedding|You're inviting me out to a feast again? Don't mind if I do!<>Eh? Before that, I have to do what...?<>What?! You're too sly, Commander! How can I refuse if we're discussing this sort of thing over a meal!

CZ805|DIALOGUE1|What's the matter, Commander? I'm right here.
CZ805|DIALOGUE2|Experience? It's not necessary for someone with so many strengths.
CZ805|DIALOGUE3|You can tell I'm really strong just from how I look, right? Then I'll let you look for a little longer. Hehe♪
CZ805|Wedding|You chose me out of all the amazing weapons here... Okay! I'll be doing my best from now on!
CZ805|Introduce|Yoohoo! The brand new and outstanding CZ-805A1 is at your service from now on! Look forward to my performance!
CZ805|ALLHALLOWS|It's really lively tonight. I guess kids will be kids. ...Huh? That cloaked fellow over there hanging from a tree, I think I've seen him before.
CZ805|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Yes, that's it, use this chance now before we attack to admire me! Don't forget to record my heroicness in battle this time.
G3|DIALOGUE1|I guess you can say I have no self-confidence... Anyways, I don't know how to explain it...
G3|DIALOGUE2|Ah, no, it's nothing...
G3|DIALOGUE3|Eek! Please don't suddenly touch me like that!
G3|Wedding|Commander, will you accept me regardless of how I look?<>Is that so...? Then please let me stay by your side and grow from your guidance.
G3|Introduce|How are you, Commander? Please call me Gr G3 from now on.
G3|ALLHALLOWS|Trick or treat, which do you prefer, Commander?
G3|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, is there anything else that I can do for you? I can't repay your trust and kindness with how little I'm doing for you...
L85A1|DIALOGUE1|I just took a bath with my glasses on...
L85A1|DIALOGUE2|You need to turn the safety off before you fire.
L85A1|DIALOGUE3|It would be fantastic if tomorrow is a sunny day as well.
L85A1|Wedding|Huh? Is this a prank, Commander?<>I'm clearly nowhere near the mark yet you've picked me... How do I repay you?<>Well, let's find the answer together!
L85A1|Introduce|Hello, I am L85A1. Care for a cup of tea, Commander?
L85A1|ALLHALLOWS|The children are playing~ It's great they're having so much fun!
L85A1|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, I made you red tea with my secret recipe. Be sure to savor it!
AR|DIALOGUE1|Hey, where do you think you're touching!?
AR|DIALOGUE2|My weight? Heheh, what are you talking about.
AR|DIALOGUE3|Ahahaha, that's super funny!
AR|Wedding|Why...did you pick me?<>Isn't someone klutzy like me the complete opposite of you, Commander?<>But if you're willing to accept me, then I will make sure you won't regret it!
AR|Introduce|Heya! I'll be counting on you from now on, my Commander.
AR|ALLHALLOWS|I love candy! ...But if I eat too much, I'll get fat. You're messing with me, right?! Com~man~der!~
AR|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, don't eat while we're working! You know I'm on a diet... Darn it, give me a little bit too!
F2000|DIALOGUE1|Do you need advice on anything, Commander?
F2000|DIALOGUE2|Are you hungry, Commander? I have snacks.
F2000|DIALOGUE3|UUUhhhiiii!! You better keep my secret to yourself, Commander. Otherwise...you know what's going to happen to you right?
F2000|Wedding|Commander, I'm truly happy today.<>You knew all along right? That I was putting on an act?<>I'll share with you my true feelings from now on. Thank you for accepting me.
F2000|Introduce|Fresh out of the factory, FF F2000, reporting! Ufufu, Commander, don't be shy and let's get along from now on!
F2000|ALLHALLOWS|Halloween huh? I don't hate horror movies, but you have to watch them with me, Commander.
F2000|DIALOGUEWEDDING|This? This is the popcorn for tonight, of course. Didn't you say you wanted to watch a movie together? I'm very excited for tonight.
M60|DIALOGUE1|The power of a weapon relies not on its performance, but rather, its user!
M60|DIALOGUE2|What's the matter? Spit it out.
M60|DIALOGUE3|We will never lose if we train every day!
M60|Wedding|This... Is this for real, Commander?<>This sort of thing...I've never trained for this before...is it okay?<>I suppose it's okay to occasionally experience some new things.
M60|Introduce|M60 reporting! Your orders, sir!
M60|ALLHALLOWS|It's Halloween! I-I hope you don't hate candy...
M60|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Don't think you can slack off just because we're close now, and don't think I didn't see you slacking off earlier. Don't tell me you've forgotten already.
M2HB|DIALOGUE1|Ahhh~ I'm so tired. Hey, can you massage my shoulders?
M2HB|DIALOGUE2|Where are you looking at?
M2HB|DIALOGUE3|Ahhh~ so annoying.
M2HB|Wedding|Commander, where are we going?<>Eh? R-really? Haha, then does that mean I get to ride in your car everyday, Commander?
M2HB|Introduce|Hey there~ Commander, are you ready to rain a hail of lead onto the enemy? I know I am~
M2HB|ALLHALLOWS|Ugh this is seriously annoying. Hurry up and bring out the candy!
M2HB|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I don't want to do anything today...but I guess I have to since I'm everybody's role model, haha...
BrenMK|DIALOGUE1|Is there a problem? Make it short.
BrenMK|DIALOGUE2|Come on. How about you quit spacing out and go do some training?
BrenMK|DIALOGUE3|W-what are you trying to do?!
BrenMK|Wedding|Commander, you've chosen me, which means...my dedication has finally been answered.<>I'm very sorry for all the inconveniences I've caused you, but please, let me continue to improve myself for you!
BrenMK|Introduce|Bren light machine gun. I can handle whatever mission you throw at me.
BrenMK|ALLHALLOWS|Pumpkins are edible. Don't you think it's a waste to wear them on your head?
BrenMK|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Am I pressing too hard? Sorry, I've rarely given massages before... I'm satisfied as long as you're comfortable.
LWMMG|DIALOGUE1|Commander, do we have enough ammo reserves?
LWMMG|DIALOGUE2|Don't worry, I can do it myself. Ah...thank you...
LWMMG|DIALOGUE3|Huh? Does anybody need help? I'm free.
LWMMG|Wedding|Is this...prepared for me? Isn't this a bit too extravagant?<>...But I'll let you have your way this time.<>I've occasionally fantasized about this scenario before, but I've never thought it would become a reality...<>I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart, Commander...
LWMMG|Introduce|Pleased to meet you, Commander. There is...no need to introduce me to the others, I'm fine working alone after all...
LWMMG|ALLHALLOWS|I didn't expect Halloween to be this busy. Everyone! You better not throw out the packaging for the candies! You can reuse them for many other purposes!
LWMMG|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, I booked us dinner at a good restuarant this weekend. You've worked hard this week, so I'll splurge a little on you.
DP28|DIALOGUE1|Perfume? Huhu, it's actually just my natural scent...
DP28|DIALOGUE2|Do you like older women?
DP28|DIALOGUE3|Hm? What's wrong, young man~?
DP28|Wedding|Oh my~, Commander, so this day has finally come.<>It's too late if you want to back out now...<>But I'll make sure you won't regret it, fufu♪. Just watch, I'll show you exactly what I mean~
DP28|Introduce|A pleasure to meet you, young man. Feel free to let me know...if you're ever troubled.
DP28|ALLHALLOWS|It sure is festive tonight. How does the candy taste, Commander?
DP28|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Want to come over and have some fun at my place this weekend? You're not too busy right? It's not like this is the first time...fufu♪
FG42|DIALOGUE1|Rest assured, Commander, everyone is practicing diligently.
FG42|DIALOGUE2|Don't slack off, the battle may start at any time.
FG42|DIALOGUE3|Commander, please work in accordance with the rules and regulations! ...Uh, is this one...allowed?
FG42|Wedding|Since I was chosen by you, that means the path that I chose was the correct one.<>I once had various worries, but now that you are by my side, I will no longer be lost.<>Thank you, Commander!
FG42|Introduce|FG42, reporting for duty. It is my humble wish to hone myself further under the Commander.
FG42|ALLHALLOWS|Even if this is a festival for fun, please avoid wearing overly exposed clothing! Although...some people's usual clothings are pretty exposed already...
FG42|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, how did today's snacks taste? ...It was better, wasn't it! I didn't strictly follow the recipe this time, but I seem to have gotten an unexpectedly good result!
AAT52|DIALOGUE1|Wanna play together, Commander?
AAT52|DIALOGUE2|Learning new tactics? Anytime is fine with me.
AAT52|DIALOGUE3|Stop shaking it, Commander. I'm going to fall if you keep shaking it!
AAT52|Wedding|Commander, have I finally become someone special to you?<>All this time, I've been learning through falling down and getting up, again and again... Perhaps...it was all for this day.<>Commander, I love you!
AAT52|Introduce|Bonjour, Commander! AAT-52, reporting for duty!
AAT52|ALLHALLOWS|For the sake of eating more candies tonight, no matter what demons or monsters lie ahead, I will defeat them all!
AAT52|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, I'm going to practice on the balance beam! Just like before, I'll leave breaking my fall to you, hehe.
M950A|DIALOGUE1|What is it? I have no interest in meaningless chitchat.
M950A|DIALOGUE2|I'm still busy, so I can only spare you a minute...only one minute, okay?
M950A|DIALOGUE3|Go bother someone else if you don't have work to do. But, don't leave me for too long...
M950A|Wedding|Heh, in the end you still needed me.<>I don't even remember when was it that you became interested in me, but it doesn't matter now...<>Let's become closer. You're...mine now...
M950A|Introduce|M950A reporting. I'll be taking your orders from now on, Commander.
M950A|ALLHALLOWS|Geez, it can't possibly get noisier than this, can it? Ahh, it seems like someone is at the door again.
M950A|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Don't even think about procrastinating, Commander. My eyes will not leave you for even a single moment. ...Wh-what is it? Did I say something odd?
M1873|DIALOGUE1|You want to know my age? ...Let's not talk about my age, Commander.
M1873|DIALOGUE2|Hey, isn't my skin smooth? It's all thanks to cola!
M1873|DIALOGUE3|Huuh? I'm drunk on cola? ...It's your imagination, you're just imagining things!
M1873|Wedding|Eh? The cola bottle looks a little different today. What are we celebrating today?<>Huh? Commander and I? ...Really?<>Then, prepare yourself! We'll be drinking cola together forever from now on!
M1873|Introduce|You called for me Commander? Do you have cola? Hey~ you have cola right?
M1873|ALLHALLOWS|Hand over the candy! Otherwise I'll trick you!
M1873|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, take this! Cola ray! Are you sober now? Clean up and continue working hard, I'll stay beside you!
M1873|CHRISTMAS|Merry Christmas! Our Christmas tree is so beautiful!
SPP1|DIALOGUE1|Oh? Commander, are you starting work?
SPP1|DIALOGUE2|Please come and watch my diving training when you get a chance next time.
SPP1|DIALOGUE3|Stop it, Commander! Don't make jokes when I'm practicing my breath-holding! Seriously!
SPP1|Wedding|Commander, give me a second, I just got out of the water...<>Eh? What?! Wait! Why are you suddenly bringing this up?<>Seriously, I'm still wet all over, if you hug me now...<>Well, if you don't mind, then okay...
SPP1|Introduce|SPP-1 Underwater Pistol, reporting! I can work on land, but I'll show you what I can really do when we're underwater!
SPP1|ALLHALLOWS|Commander, what are you preparing? Even if it is Halloween tonight, you're not allowed to go and scare children as you wish.
SPP1|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, how's your breath-holding training going? We're tackling deeper waters next time. If you're lacking in training, I can train you myself.
Mk23|DIALOGUE1|Are you calling for me, Darling?
Mk23|DIALOGUE2|What do you wanna do? I'll accompany you.
Mk23|DIALOGUE3|If you're not going to behave yourself even during working hours, then I'm gonna fight back! Take this!
Mk23|Wedding|I was worried that you would get annoyed if I kept pestering you, but I couldn't help myself.<>Perhaps...it was decided since the very beginning...<>But it doesn't matter now. You've given me a new purpose, so let me call you one more time, Darling...
Mk23|Introduce|Hello~ Commander. We'll be together from now on!
Mk23|ALLHALLOWS|There will be many brats dressing up nicely tonight, but you...must keep your eyes on me.
Mk23|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Darling, what would you like to have for tomorrow's breakfast? I've already prepared a snack for tonight, hehe. Choose wisely~
P7|DIALOGUE1|No matter how much I prank you, you never get angry. You're really the best, Commander!
P7|DIALOGUE2|Commander, who do you want to see get pranked next? It'll be my pleasure.
P7|DIALOGUE3|Stop wasting time, Commander, come and help me think up a plan. ...A plan for what? For pranking people of course!
P7|Wedding|Ahah, you still fell into the palm of my hand in the end.<>Relax, Commander, I'm being serious about this as well. After all, we've known each other for so many years...<>It hasn't been that long? Don't worry, it will be in the future, hehe...
P7|Introduce|The long-awaited P7 is finally reporting for duty! Everyone, let's all be friends!
P7|ALLHALLOWS|Trick or treat! Hehe, I've received so many candies tonight. Do you know why? It's obviously because I'm adorable!
P7|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, the trap at the door is all set, please enjoy! ...But before that, let's make one thing clear. You're mine! Don't even think about being a hero and rescuing the damsel in distress!
P7|VALENTINE|You received that many chocolates? Hmm...I gave you some as well. Did you notice?
TT33|DIALOGUE1|Commander, can I speak to you for a second? If you are a so-called gentleman then you can't go around touching people like that.
TT33|DIALOGUE2|Commander, you're such a lecher...
TT33|DIALOGUE3|Commander, focus on your WORK!
TT33|Wedding|Huh, Commander, what are you doing here?<>I can handle it here by myself...<>Huh? Pardon? “Business" between two people? I don't really get what you mean, but you'll show me right?
TT33|Introduce|Ah, Commander? I'm pleased to meet you.
TT33|ALLHALLOWS|It's not like I'm afraid of ghosts and monsters or anything...but it's okay if I stay with you, right, Commander?
TT33|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I'm not leaving until you go to bed. I'm going to make sure that I take good care of you, because after all, we made vows to each other.
TT33|VALENTINE|Commander, today is... Please take this! It's nothing fancy but...I hope you'll accept it. Haaah, thank goodness! I'm so happy!
PM|DIALOGUE1|Hm? What's the matter?
PM|DIALOGUE2|Hi, how's it going?
PM|DIALOGUE3|Hey, lets go out and play together.
PM|Wedding|Commander, being able to get your approval and stand by your side means everything to me.<>I will never forget this moment. Please let it last forever...
PM|Introduce|Rather than the Commander giving orders, working together is the better plan. Under me that is~
PM|ALLHALLOWS|Where's everyone hiding?~ Get ready to be pranked~
PM|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Everyone's in great shape today. These outstanding results…it's all because of our close partnership, isn't it?
P08|DIALOGUE1|How will we proceed with today's tactics exercise?
P08|DIALOGUE2|Efficiency is the number one priority. What do you think, Commander?
P08|DIALOGUE3|Commander, you still haven't finished the reports from yesterday yet? What is the meaning of this?
P08|Wedding|Commander, from when did you start noticing me?<>Will you seek more glory together with me?<>Yes, I will become your strength and forever fight for you!
P08|Introduce|P08 pistol. I may not be the best at everything, but I look forward to working under you!
P08|ALLHALLOWS|Today is Halloween isn't it, Commander? I'm not a child anymore, so I don't want any candies.
P08|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, I will believe in you as usual for today's battle. Please grant me your blessings, so that I may bring you more glory.
M1911|DIALOGUE1|Are you bored?
M1911|DIALOGUE2|It's embarrassing to be looked at by everyone like this...
M1911|DIALOGUE3|I-I don't mind...if it's Darling...
M1911|Wedding|Commander, my feelings...have they finally been answered?<>Heheh♪ Your decision was so sudden, I don't know how to respond...<>From today onward, I'm going to love you so much that you won't know what to do!

M1911|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Darling, do you still need anything? We're this close already, you don't need to be shy about it.
M1895|DIALOGUE1|Does my height bother you that much? Stop asking me this kind of question.
M1895|DIALOGUE2|Don't pat my head! How dare you treat me like a child!
M1895|DIALOGUE3|Will I really grow taller if I drink milk...? You'd better not be lying to me!
M1895|Wedding|Oh? Commander, I didn't expect you to have such tastes...I wonder if this is really ok?~<>Anyways, I have no objections... Well...good, let's...examine this relationship together.
M1895|Introduce|You're quite the odd one for having tastes in someone as old as I, aren't you?
M1895|ALLHALLOWS|These girls, they're so childish. Aren't these sweets meant for children? I don't want to eat them at all!
M1895|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander! Commander! Look at what I found today! Doesn't it look pretty? This is a special gift for you, so keep it safe!
P38|DIALOGUE1|How can I get more fans?
P38|DIALOGUE2|Time to sing! LaLaLa~♪

P38|Wedding|Eh? It's not like you to tease the center of the team like this, Commander!<>What was that? Really?<>This...this is a little too sudden... Can I really stay by your side?
P38|Introduce|This is...the fated encounter!
P38|ALLHALLOWS|Tadaa~ I transformed into a witch today~ Am I cute?
P38|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I'll dedicate my secret melodies to you tonight! Please look forward to my performance!
PPK|DIALOGUE1|What, are you thinking of something bad?
PPK|DIALOGUE2|Who gave you permission to touch me?
PPK|DIALOGUE3|Endure it until I grant you permission.
PPK|Wedding|If I refuse in this situation, wouldn't it be more interesting?<>Fine, I'll be more serious this time. Then, you'll have to take responsibiity for anything that happens, understand?
PPK|Introduce|Hehe♪ Commander, being able to meet you here, I am thoroughly delighted.
PPK|ALLHALLOWS|Commander~ Give me candies, otherwise...I'll have to punish you~
PPK|DIALOGUEWEDDING|What is it that you expect from staring at me like that all the time? ...Fine, since you've been obedient today, let me reward you.
MP446|DIALOGUE1|Commander, want to go out and play with me?

M1928A1|DIALOGUE1|Boss! Who said you could touch people like that!
M1928A1|DIALOGUE2|A world without police? That's great, I can do as I like now!
M1928A1|DIALOGUE3|Just being together with my comrades is enough for me.
M1928A1|Wedding|Yo, Commander. Calling me to a place like this, are we gonna have a street fight?<>What?! Oh, you?...Well, I mean, it's not like I dislike you...<>Let's fight for our future together.
M1928A1|Introduce|You're the new boss eh? Chicago Typewriter, I'll be in your care.
M1928A1|ALLHALLOWS|Boss, since it's Halloween, we should give candies to the children!
M1928A1|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Boss, need some music during your break? Same as usual, huh... So, the tune from that night?
Vector|DIALOGUE1|Advice? Will you even listen to it?
Vector|DIALOGUE2|It's okay... Don't worry about it.
Vector|DIALOGUE3|My origins, my prototype, these are all meaningless. After all, I'm just a tool that follows orders...
Vector|Wedding|I'd never expected a result like this.<>Since I've always been difficult with you, I'll take it as my loss this time.<>But, don't think that it's going to end like this.
Vector|Introduce|Oh? A new Commander? Well...let's all get along.
Vector|ALLHALLOWS|I love these kinds of things. I wouldn't mind if this sort of atmosphere could continue on forever~
Vector|DIALOGUEWEDDING|How much longer can you continue with this act? If you can't pretend any longer then say so. I don't want to believe that all of this is real...
MP5|DIALOGUE1|Commander, what's your favorite color? Mine's black!
MP5|DIALOGUE2|I'll drink milk every day!
MP5|DIALOGUE3|I might not be very suitable for combat...

UMP9|DIALOGUE1|Commander! ...Hehe♪ It's nothing!
UMP9|DIALOGUE2|45, are you here? Oh, it's the Commander!
UMP9|DIALOGUE3|What are you doing, Commander! I'm not in that kind of relationship with you yet...
UMP9|Wedding|This warm feeling...<>Is this the feeling of "love"?<>With this, we can finally become a real family...
UMP9|Introduce|UMP9 has come home! Everybody, we're family now!
UMP9|VALENTINE|Commander, haven't you received quite a lot of chocolates today? ...Then it's ok to accept one more, right? Hehe♪
UMP9|ALLHALLOWS|Trick or treat!
UMP9|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, are you heading out? As your family, should I be giving you a "goodbye kiss"? You were looking forward to it, right?! I saw in your eyes!
MAC10|DIALOGUE1|Commander, please watch your step. You nearly stepped on an ant...
MAC10|DIALOGUE2|Friends? I'm not interested in such a thing...
MAC10|DIALOGUE3|To be liked by everyone...not once have I ever thought of wanting such a thing. The strong...are lonely.
MAC10|Wedding|Commander, you would accept even a person like me?<>Alright, I understand, Commander. Let us look for fun things to do together.
MAC10|Introduce|If it's the Commander's orders...then I, Ingram MAC-10...would be delighted to serve.

PPS43|DIALOGUE2|I'm fine as long as big sis is here.
PPS43|DIALOGUE3|Late people should all be executed! Any complaints?
PPS43|Wedding|Commander, is this for big sis 41?<>W-w-what?! For me? Really? ...And here I was wishing to grow up, I'm such an idiot, haha♪
PPS43|Introduce|Comrade, it is my greatest honor to meet you. I may be a lightweight, but I have my merits.
PPS43|ALLHALLOWS|I hope I won't be a bother to big sis for this year's Halloween! Time to look for a new target~
PPS43|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, what are you doing? Let me help! I need to be more proactive from now on since I've been chosen by you.
VZ61|DIALOGUE1|Commander, if you keep on touching me, I'll shoot you until you look like a beehive.
VZ61|DIALOGUE2|Don't underestimate me, my entire family has been used by many different organizations.
VZ61|DIALOGUE3|Skorpion is such a cool name, right?!
VZ61|Wedding|Commander, to make such a decision, do you really understand me? <7.5>Is that so? Then, I have nothing more to say. The past is the past, and the future...<8.5>let us face it together!<2>
VZ61|Introduce|I'm VZ61 Skorpion~ Nice to meet you~ Even though I'm a scorpion I'm totally poisonless.
VZ61|ALLHALLOWS|Commander~ Give me candy~

StenMK2|ALLHALLOWS|I want to have fun like a little kid! Isn't today the perfect day to do so?
StenMK2|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, don't go to the cafeteria after work today. I've prepared some desserts for you... Hehe, I have to show off my skills once in a while!
StenMK2|VALENTINE|I won't give you any "honmei choco" this time!~ Happy Valentine's Day, Commander.
MicroUZI|DIALOGUE1|You're staring again...I've said that it's embarassing, didn't I?
MicroUZI|DIALOGUE2|I'm... I'm... It's nothing!
MicroUZI|DIALOGUE3|H-How can I say such a thing!
MicroUZI|Wedding|Why did you suddenly give me something like this! Idiot, don't make me shoot you!<>I... This sort of thing...<>Alright, I don't particularly dislike you, so I'll look after you...
MicroUZI|Introduce|Just where are you looking at!? It's e-embarrassing, so stop it!
MicroUZI|ALLHALLOWS|Hey hey~ If you don't want to be tricked, then hand over the candies quickly!
MicroUZI|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Trying to run away from work again? Alright...since you've been working so hard, I'll pretend I didn't see you this time.
PPsh41|DIALOGUE1|Eh? Oh...you scared me.
PPsh41|DIALOGUE2|Erm...is something the matter?
PPsh41|DIALOGUE3|I'm fine being on the sidelines...
PPsh41|Wedding|Commander, being able to bond with you through this sacred contract is the happiest moment of my life.<>From now on, I will bring more and more glory to you!
PPsh41|Introduce|Pleased to meet you, Commander! Eh? I'm not heavy at all!
PPsh41|ALLHALLOWS|Is it already Halloween? Commander, please be careful of my sister PPS-43...
PPsh41|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, how was my performance last time? If you want, I can choose a better song to dedicate to you next time.
PPsh41|VALENTINE|Commander, please accept this. There's no special meaning to it, really...
PP2000|DIALOGUE1|Yes, what's the matter?
PP2000|DIALOGUE2|Is there something troubling you?
PP2000|DIALOGUE3|The weather is nice today.
PP2000|Wedding|Asking me to come here...did I make a mistake somewhere, Commander?<>...Eh? Such a thing?! I-Is is really ok? Have I...finally been recognized by you, Commander?...
PP2000|Introduce|PP-2000 submachine gun. I will be staying by your side from now on, hehe~
PP2000|ALLHALLOWS|My reaction was a little bit extreme during today's test of courage...I ended up scaring the ghost instead...
PP2000|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, my performance today was very steady, right? I need to become more confident since you're relying on me after all.
MP40|DIALOGUE1|Ah! You scared me!
MP40|DIALOGUE2|I-I didn't gain weight! Speaking of which, Commander, don't just go around touching people!
MP40|DIALOGUE3|The concept of "component standardization" in manufacturing only came into existence because of me.
MP40|Wedding|What are the plans for today, Commander?<>Eh? This--... To bestow such an honor upon me, I never would've expected this.<>I'm extremely happy! Thank you very much, Commander!
MP40|Introduce|Commander, I will do my best for you!
MP40|ALLHALLOWS|The kids will play tricks on you if you don't give them candy… What a weird custom… I'm not really used to it...
MP40|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, how was my piano perfomance last? Expressing my feelings through the prim and orderly music score was something that I learn from you while at your side... Were you able to notice it?
MAB38|DIALOGUE1|Eh? Oh, don't worry, I'm doing fine.
MAB38|DIALOGUE2|I'm sure putting in hard work will pay off some day.
MAB38|DIALOGUE3|One of my strengths? I'd say it would be my concentration.
MAB38|Wedding|Commander, calling me out here, are you trying to sell me off...<>Eh?! This can't be...my...my hard work...it shouldn't have been a match for your expections...<>Nevertheless, I'll stay by your side, and continue to work harder!
MAB38|Introduce|M38, let's get along from now on, Commander.
MAB38|ALLHALLOWS|It's Halloween! Can I go play with the kids?
MAB38|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, I'm studying hard on battlefield tactics right now. If I'm gonna be by your side forever, it is only fair that I become a capable assistant too!
SpectreM4|DIALOGUE1|Commander, when's it gonna be my turn?
SpectreM4|DIALOGUE2|Peace isn't that bad, but...it feels a little too comfortable...
SpectreM4|DIALOGUE3|Commander, I was being treated unexpectedly well today, you'd think they mistook me for someone else! ...What? Seriously?
SpectreM4|Wedding|Commander, Commander, why'd you pick me!<>Ah, it must be because of my immense popularity! ...Ahaha, I know, that's a lie.<>Well, it doesn't matter, because you still chose me in the end, right? Right?
SpectreM4|Introduce|Spectre M4, formally joining your ranks, sir! Um... Commander? Is there no welcoming party?
SpectreM4|ALLHALLOWS|Oh! It's Halloween? Well then, let me join too! ...What's that? Take the kids trick-or-treating? Sounds good!
SpectreM4|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, I was also very active in front of everyone today. With your support, nothing's impossible for me!
WA2000|DIALOGUE1|Idiot...if I really hated you then I wouldn't be talking to you.
WA2000|DIALOGUE2|Listen carefully! Don't casually call my name and don't touch my gun with your filthy hands!
WA2000|DIALOGUE3|Eh? My face is red? It's because...it's a bit hot today! D-Don't get the wrong idea!
WA2000|Wedding|I'm a tool created solely for the purpose of killing, and I've never thought about anything else besides that.<>Commander, are you sure you want me by your side?<>Hmm...with this, perhaps I'll become even more perfect.
WA2000|Introduce|My name is WA2000. Commander, stand aside and don't get in my way.
WA2000|ALLHALLOWS|Eek! I wasn't scared or anything! Ah! Don't bring that jack-o'-lantern any closer!
WA2000|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Is there anything else left to do? Letting someone so valuable like myself be busy the entire day, you'd better reward me well after work, okay?
WA2000|CHRISTMAS|Since you look like you're free, and you look so pitiful being alone, I will accompany you for a bit...
MLEMK1|DIALOGUE1|Just give the order...
MLEMK1|DIALOGUE2|I feel reassured if it is you, Commander.

NTW20|DIALOGUE1|Could you not stand behind me?
NTW20|DIALOGUE2|Who's there? ....Oh, it's just you, Commander. If you so much as touch me, you'll get hurt.
NTW20|DIALOGUE3|Just leave the sniping missions to me. Even if it's a cheetah sprinting in the prairie, I'll tag it in one shot.
NTW20|Wedding|Ever since the beginning, I have always obtained my strength from you, and I have always remembered it.<>In this very moment, I've finally found a chance to repay you. Thank you, Commander.
NTW20|Introduce|Commander, I am the anti-materiel rifle NTW-20. Fortified steel wall or not, I will show you I can pierce through it all.
NTW20|ALLHALLOWS|Speaking of Halloween, are you going to host a costume party? I would look forward to it.
NTW20|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, let's go hunting again on our next vacation! Don't worry, I'll give you a head start, hehe!
NTW20|CHRISTMAS|Will it snow on Christmas? I've never seen snow before...I really look forward to it.
M1903|DIALOGUE1|I made some muffins. Let's eat them together.
M1903|DIALOGUE2|You have some bread crumbs on your mouth, ufufu~. Stay still please, I will get it for you.
M1903|DIALOGUE3|Good work as always, Commander. If you would like, have some coffee.
M1903|Wedding|Commander, how did you come to notice me?<>A gentle person like you will become my other half from now on...<>Then, let me become your most reliable strength!
M1903|Introduce|Commander, if there is anything I can do for you then please, give the order.
M1903|ALLHALLOWS|Ufufu~, it's Halloween, isn't it? M14 is having so much fun.
M1903|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, I will be heading out soon. You'll be fine here, right? When you miss me, just say my name out loud. I will surely hear it.
M1903|CHRISTMAS|Ufufu~, since it is Christmas, I am going to cook with my best efforts today.
M1891|DIALOGUE1|Oh my, what's the matter?
M1891|DIALOGUE2|I'm hungry. Is there anything to eat?
M1891|DIALOGUE3|Hehe, interested in me?
M1891|Wedding|You've been helping me along all this time, but now I wish you'll put some faith in me. <>I will forever be by your side. This is the happiest moment of my life.
M1891|Introduce|Comrade, хорошо!
M1891|ALLHALLOWS|Nagant M1895 ran off to somewhere again. I don't want to take off my hat even if it is Halloween... How troublesome.
M1891|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, you seem to be tired from work. Want to go for a walk? There are many things I want to share with you today.
PTRD|DIALOGUE1|Ahh... Don't you think war is such a drag?
PTRD|DIALOGUE2|Hey... If you want to touch me, at least do it seriously.
PTRD|DIALOGUE3|Are your preparations complete?
PTRD|Wedding|Oh? Being so straightforward about it, that's not like you.<>Still, I don't dislike it, and it's saved a lot of effort.<>May I offer a gesture of gratitude?
PTRD|Introduce|Worry not, Commander, there is nothing that can escape from my bullet.
PTRD|VALENTINE|Today is Valentine's Day, Commander. Please accept my feelings. Otherwise...
PTRD|ALLHALLOWS|I did prepare a costume for the masquerade, but putting it on is too much work, so I gave it way to another kid.
PTRD|DIALOGUEWEDDING|You've worked hard today, Commander. I learned some massage techniques recently. Want to give them a try after work?
SV98|DIALOGUE1|What's our next target?
SV98|DIALOGUE2|I'm not suited for close quarters combat, but you can leave long-range sniping to me.
SV98|DIALOGUE3|I'll shoot you right through the heart! Bang~! ...Ahh! Commander! Did you hear me?
SV98|Wedding|Umm... This kind of thing is well beyond my expectation...<>But I don't need to make any notes, right? After all, it's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.<>Commander, I will always remember this moment.
SV98|Introduce|SV-98, reporting in, what are your orders?
SV98|ALLHALLOWS|As I thought, I'm no good at Halloween... Both my costume and my tricks are a bit underwhelming...
SV98|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Today's workload is a bit more than I expected...but no matter, I'll stay beside you regardless of how late it gets!
SVT38|DIALOGUE1|Ah, my apologies. I accidentally fell asleep.
SVT38|DIALOGUE2|The word "defeat" is not in my vocabulary.
SVT38|DIALOGUE3|What is it? Do you need me for something?
SVT38|Wedding|W-What's that all of a sudden, Commander?!<>I-Is this also a kind of victory? Or... No, nevermind. It doesn't hurt to enjoy things once in a while.<>After all, moments like this are precious.
SVT38|Introduce|SVT-38 reporting. Commander, your orders?
SVT38|ALLHALLOWS|I wanted to dress up as a ghost to scare people, but it seems that I'm more scary as my usual self... I see...
SVT38|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Today's arrangements seem to be sound as always... Goodness, after being with you for some time, I've become quite lazy...
SKS|DIALOGUE1|Don't think, feel it! Haaaaa!
SKS|DIALOGUE2|My, my. Guys seem to be swarming around me these days.

TAR21|DIALOGUE1|Ah, right on time. I have some questions for you.
TAR21|DIALOGUE2|I may not look like it, but I'm actually very ordinary.
TAR21|DIALOGUE3|My usual training? There's tea ceremony, flower arrangement, kendo, and ballet as well.
TAR21|Wedding|It's only natural that I, who was born in a new era, managed to catch your eye.<>I guess it can't be helped. I will keep updating myself in order to live up to your expectations.<>I will show you an even better me!
TAR21|Introduce|TAR-21, reporting for duty. Please take extra good care of me.

STG44|DIALOGUE1|Can you please stop staring at me like that?

OTs12|DIALOGUE1|Um...what do you think of my recent performance?
OTs12|DIALOGUE2|Commander, are there any tasks for me?
OTs12|DIALOGUE3|Stop messing around, Commander. Isn't this a covert mission?
OTs12|Wedding|Commander, is this...for me?<>No, please don't apologize, I've always been aware of my own value.<>But, I will keep this in my heart as the most treasured secret. Thank you, Commander...
OTs12|Introduce|Secret weapon OTs-12 "Yew Tree", reporting. Commander, is any further explanation required?
OTs12|ALLHALLOWS|Tonight's atmosphere isn't very suitable for a secret operation, though it'll probably be easier to hide in the midst of all these oddly-dressed people.
OTs12|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I've been making appearances more often lately, maybe it's because you value me too much... No matter, such a happy thing doesn't need to be kept secret.
SIG510|DIALOGUE1|Can I...really make some friends...?

PK|ALLHALLOWS|I will not participate in such an indulgent holiday!

PK|VALENTINE|Hmm... A day to affirm the existence of each other? Sounds nice... Then I'll give this to you, Commander.
MG3|DIALOGUE1|W-Where are you touching? What if they get even bigger than they already are?!
MG3|DIALOGUE2|This chest of mine keeps getting in the way and I can't do anything about it!
MG3|DIALOGUE3|Alright, it's time we get something to eat!
MG3|Wedding|Commander, why are you so interested in me? It must be because of that... Huh? That's not it? Alright! Then, from now on...let's train lots together and become stronger!
MG3|Introduce|So this is where I've been assigned to, huh? MG3 reporting in! Let's give the enemy a taste of true firepower!
MG3|ALLHALLOWS|Seriously, give me a break! Why do I have to give candy to brats...
MG3|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Put more effort into it, Commander, I know you have the potential! Don't give up so easily!

G11|DIALOGUE3|Urgh... don't hit me... I know, I'll get up now....
G11|Wedding|Commander, what did you wake me up so late for?<>Eh? Could this be...that so-called "confession"? Seeing that wholehearted expression on your face, I wouldn't be able to sleep properly if I didn't accept your feelings.<>Alright...just this once.
G11|Introduce|G11... Commander, you got a bed around here?
G11|ALLHALLOWS|If it's just a festival for giving me candy, taking part in it won't be bad... Huh? There's more to it than that? Never mind then.
