xm3|SOULCONTRACT|You've had your eyes on me this whole time, Commander? <>Well...I suppose it's hardly surprising that I've offended you many times... <>What? That's not what you mean? Then... Huh?! How could this be?! I...I'm not dreaming, am I?
xm3|Introduce|XM3 is an obscure weapon used by the USMC. Originally developed by IBA following DARPA's design to compensate for the limitations of the M40A3, it eventually garnered positive feedback in tests. I don't think this is due to improved weapons, rather it's because people have started to realize their own shortcoming.
xm3|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Do you understand what you did wrong on our last date, Commander? ...It's okay. I'll forgive you if you give me a hug...
xm3|GAIN|It is up to you how you wish to utilize me, Commander. Please make good use of this power from now on. I...I'm not dreaming, am I?
XM8|DIALOGUE1|Forget about that dumb battle plan of yours. I don't want someone who just sits around in an office all day tell me how to fight.
XM8|DIALOGUE2|Want to play chess with me, Commander? Don't worry, I'll make it a stalemate out of respect for you~
XM8|DIALOGUE3|I'm lighter than I look. Try lifting me up if you don't believe me.
XM8|SOULCONTRACT|Commander...I didn't think you of all people would make me feel embarrassed like this.<>To click with someone like me with such a bad personality, I'm nearly moved to tears!<>Perhaps the only person that can accept every aspect of myself...would be you, Commander.
XM8|Introduce|I heard there are a lot of interesting people here, but...you don't look very interesting at all. Don't disappoint me now.
XM8|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Thank you for your hard work, my dear Commander~❤ ...Hehe~ Was that too sappy for you?
XM8|GAIN|I heard there are a lot of interesting people here, but...you don't look very interesting at all. Don't disappoint me now.
Z62|DIALOGUE1|Yes, I'm here. Please give me your instructions.
Z62|DIALOGUE2|Commander, can you teach me how to solve this problem?
Z62|DIALOGUE3|Commander, read a book if you have this much spare time.
Z62|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, thank you for choosing me. In order to meet your expectations, I will devote my mind and soul to doing the best that I can!
Z62|Introduce|Star Z-62. Commander, I'm grateful for you taking me in and letting me join the team.
Z62|ALLHALLOWS|Tonight will definitely be very rowdy. I'd better stay in my room to read.
Z62|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, the books you've recommended recently are full of flair. We really are becoming more and more in sync, so I'll be counting on you from now on.
Z62|GAIN|Star Z-62. Commander, I'm grateful for you taking me in and letting me join the team.
ZastavaM21|DIALOGUE1|You're really diligent, aren't you, Commander? I wouldn't mind even if you slacked off a bit.
ZastavaM21|DIALOGUE2|Anthropomorphizing weapons... If you ask me, the form of a T-Doll is a bit too impractical.
ZastavaM21|DIALOGUE3|What do you think of my painted nails? Want me to do yours?
ZastavaM21|SOULCONTRACT|...Hey, what's the matter? This is the first time I've seen you like this.<>If you ask me, this is not a wise decision at all...<>However, perhaps my sense of reality has become a little crazy because of you...❤
ZastavaM21|Introduce|About myself? Developed as an improvement upon the original AK series by Zas Arms, I was born out of humanity's long history in war profiteering. There's nothing much more to say. Perhaps human beings rely upon the evolution of their weapons to prove their own evolution.
ZastavaM21|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, instead of thinking about the next date, why not think about how to make me happy today? Hehe...
ZastavaM21|CHRISTMAS|What will it take for me to believe in Santa Claus? If my bullets hit him... Just kidding.
ZastavaM21|GAIN|Commander... Yes, just as it says on the file, I am Zas M21. I hope you won't mind my performance.
CLEAR|DIALOGUE1|Nothing can replace me when I'm one with the music!
CLEAR|DIALOGUE2|What sort of melody can I play on a stage filled with smoke?
CLEAR|DIALOGUE3|Wanna see how I fight? Heheh... Then you'd better keep those ears perked!
CLEAR|SOULCONTRACT|I've foreseen this moment long ago... <>I always see my radiance in the depths of your eyes. <>Come... You're my only one. You're my only light!
CLEAR|Introduce|Feeling dazzled? Then stop running and seize it instead! This is the Glorylight that you've been longing for!
CLEAR|DIALOGUEWEDDING|What genre do you fancy today? Haha! I can put the same song on loop if that's what you want!
CLEAR|GAIN|Feeling dazzled? Then stop running and seize it instead! This is the Glorylight that you've been longing for!

FAIL|DIALOGUE2|Hand your soul to me. I'll give you everything. Victory, melody, and all the love in the world!
FAIL|DIALOGUE3|Wanna see what's so cute about me? Haha! Better keep your eyes wide open then!
FAIL|SOULCONTRACT|Heheh...you've been looking forward to this, haven't you? <>Spin me around... Now I'm all you see! <>Come... Obey your only desire. Obey the one and only me!
FAIL|Introduce|Heheh... Are bad girls welcome in a place like this? Then let me show you the light shining from deep within chaos!
FAIL|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Still wanna try out more genres? No can do! You can only choose my favorite... Lose yourself in me!
FAIL|GAIN|Heheh... Are bad girls welcome in a place like this? Then let me show you the light shining from deep within chaos!
AUG|DIALOGUE1|We are tools used to replace humans on the battlefield. Therefore, a human life is saved every time we die in their place.
AUG|DIALOGUE2|I like rainy days. The rain lets my expression look...more natural.
AUG|DIALOGUE3|Commander, you will not have the chance for remorse for many situations out there if you act too rashly.
AUG|SOULCONTRACT|Haha... The floral fragrance here exudes an aura completely opposite of mine.<>I've always thought that only sorrow can make a person cry...<>If what I am feeling now can be expressed by tears...then I might not be able to stop myself.
AUG|Introduce|Commander, if you wish to send flowers to the enemy's funeral...then I am your best choice.
AUG|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, it seems like it will rain soon. Would you like to go for a walk? ...Bring a smaller umbrella so we can be closer together...
AUG|GAIN|Commander, if you wish to send flowers to the enemy's funeral...then I am the perfect choice.
T77|DIALOGUE1|Understood, so it's a new mission... it isn't? Then what are you doing?
T77|DIALOGUE2|You can judge my mood by how many centimeters my arms are raised above my head.
T77|DIALOGUE3|...Commander, why are you so slow? ...No, that's not it, my eyes clearly didn't mean that...
T77|SOULCONTRACT|Commander... what's the meaning of this?  <>N-no, I was just worried that I'd gotten the wrong idea again... <>What the heck, it looks like you completely understood how I was going to react... ❤
T77|Introduce|...Huh? You still can't tell, Commander? You should be able to understand from a glance that I'm the new recruit, T77...
T77|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, our synchronization is perfect. I'm beginning to like how our mutual affinity feels...heehee.
T77|GAIN|...Huh? You still can't tell, Commander? You should be able to understand from a glance that I'm the new recruit, T77...
MP443|DIALOGUE1|Huh? Can't I have the diamond ring? It's so pretty... You're stingy, Commander.
MP443|DIALOGUE2|My sister has run off again. Finding her is harder than finding a rock.
MP443|DIALOGUE3|All these rocks have been meticulously sculpted by me. Nobody would even spare them a glance before they turned out like this.
MP443|SOULCONTRACT|Wanna turn me into your most prized possession, Commander? <>Looks like...my value as a "rock" has finally been recognized... <>Heheh, then from now on, I belong only to you... ❤
MP443|Introduce|Oh? I was only looking for interesting rocks. Didn't expect to find something even more interesting... I hope you don't mind joining the Rook's collection, Commander?
MP443|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Let's count how many rocks I found today, Commander? I'll give you whichever one you like... ❤
MP443|GAIN|Oh? I was only looking for interesting rocks. Didn't expect to find something even more interesting... I hope you don't mind joining the Rook's collection, Commander?
Carcano1891_0|DIALOGUE1|Cino~ over here! Stay close or you'll be left behind!
Carcano1891_0|DIALOGUE2|My clothes and Cino's turned out very well this time! Designing children's clothes is pretty tough, you know.
Carcano1891_0|DIALOGUE3|How big is your hand, Commander? Let's compare!
Carcano1891_0|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, you have always been the most trusted person in my heart...<>Haha, sorry... "In a Doll's heart" would sound pretty weird, right?<>But as long as I am in your heart, then that's all that matters to me...❤
Carcano1891_0|Introduce|Carcano M1891, this name takes after the name of the chief technician that designed me, but people have also called me M91. I have fought through the three most brutal wars in the history of mankind, brought smile upon the faces of victors, and brought pain to the defeated... So, Commander, are you prepared for the consequences of accepting me?
Carcano1891_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, it's important to be happy every day! However, there shouldn't be any reason for you to be unhappy as long as I'm around, right? Ehehe~
Carcano1891_0|GAIN|Carcano M1891 reporting for duty! I finally get to meet you, Commander! The justice and ideals you seek, I will witness them together with you!
Carcano1938_0|DIALOGUE1|W-Wait up, sister! You're so slow I can't catch up with you!
Carcano1938_0|DIALOGUE2|Lying children grow long noses. Mine hasn't grown, so I'm not lying.
Carcano1938_0|DIALOGUE3|These are only clothes made by my sister. Touch it all you want. I don't care at all...
Carcano1938_0|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, are you looking forward to a vow filled with lies?<>...Even in lies, you would believe in me?<>In that case...regardless if it is a lie or not, every aspect of myself belongs to you now...❤
Carcano1938_0|Introduce|As a modified variant of my older sister M1891, I, Carcano M91/38, have also been a witness to many years of human history... Although I should've only been a witness, I have actually riddled that history with bullet marks... That is probably the biggest lie I've unleashed upon this world.
Carcano1938_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|The people I hate the most, other than my sister, is you, Commander... Yes, I hate your expression that knows I'm lying yet is still playing along.
Carcano1938_0|GAIN|Hello, Commander. As you may notice, I am a joyful and lively T-Doll, so let's be good friends with each other.
FN57_0|DIALOGUE1|Hold tightly onto my hand, Commander. I'll be very upset if you get lost~
FN57_0|DIALOGUE2|You need to cultivate an appreciation for things from a young age, otherwise you'll end up with weird tastes like FAL when you grow up.
FN57_0|DIALOGUE3|It seems like I'm very popular. Is it because I can understand everyone's words?
FN57_0|SOULCONTRACT|Commander...this moment has finally come....<>The more people and affairs I deal with, the more I lose myself, but you always pulled me back when I needed help the most.<>Thank you. Please let me stay with you from now on and become your most trusted partner.

PP19_0|DIALOGUE1|If I fight in this form...it might take the enemy by surprise. It's worth a try!
PP19_0|DIALOGUE2|No missions yet? There's a limit to a child's patience.
PP19_0|DIALOGUE3|Commander, I won't accept adults teasing me.
PP19_0|SOULCONTRACT|What is with that face, Commander?<>...Huh? What are you...? No, no. I'm asking why are you saying something like this all of a sudden! Don't look at me like that, I will also—<>I'm also... fine with it...
PP19_0|Introduce|PP-19 Bizon submachine gun excels in all regards, whether it's firepower, precision, magazine capacity, or stability. nI'm not bragging. After all, my bloodline is a mix of AK and SVD, and I have made use of many of their good designs while having my own distinct characteristics. ...Yes, this is the helical magazine. It's really unique, isn't it?
PP19_0|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Is it because of this body? Lately I've been getting up later... Commander, could you wake me up?
PP19_0|GAIN|PP-19-01, reporting in! So you're the Commander eh? Well then, you'd better remember me!
CBJMS_0|DIALOGUE1|I'm growing up now, so I can't let the fish bones go to waste... (Nom) They're kind of hard...
CBJMS_0|DIALOGUE2|Commander, I want a horsey ride! Hurry!
CBJMS_0|DIALOGUE3|Nom~ ...Bleh bleh bleh! Uuu...you taste worse than this fish, Commander...
CBJMS_0|SOULCONTRACT|As my number one subordinate, it seems like you've realized something, Commander.<>You've always done your best for me, and I believe...no one can replace you in my heart.<>And I also believe that...in your heart, I hold the same importance as well...❤

Thunder50_0|DIALOGUE2|Only scars don't fade as you grow up...
Thunder50_0|DIALOGUE3|Is it time for "punishment" again? ...Oh, right, I'm not at that place anymore.
Thunder50_0|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, you've done well to sense what I was thinking. You should know how I feel right now...<>Though I'm not very likeable, please keep me by your side forever. Please, promise me.

Thunder50_0|GAIN|I've never seen your face before, are you new? ...Ah, excuse me, that should be your line, right?
GSH18|DIALOGUE1|Huh? What? If there's anything, please let me know as soon as possible. Wait, wait! What are you doing!?
GSH18|DIALOGUE2|I don't think I disappointed anyone during the previous issue... I think... (Mutters) It should be okay... right...?
GSH18|DIALOGUE3|Commander~ want to move around a little? Sitting down all the time is bad for your body, you know. (Starts doing pushups) 1 ~ 2 ~ 3 ~!
GSH18|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, if it wasn't for you standing by my side, I would never have been able to persevere until now... <>I'll always look forward to every order you give, every time you praise me, every time you trust me... <>And now...every reassuring smile of yours, Commander.

GSH18|GAIN|GSh-18 officially joining! I can complete any mission no matter how hard it gets! Deploy me whenever!
TAC50|DIALOGUE1|My left eye can exchange visions with Maple Moon, which means you can access my visual input from Maple Moon.
TAC50|DIALOGUE2|I've prepared some snacks. Mashed potatoes with maple syrup, marshmallows with maple syrup... Hmm. They all look delicious!
TAC50|DIALOGUE3|Is this some sort of method to further our relationship, Commander? ...Okay, I'll try my best to cooperate...
TAC50|SOULCONTRACT|I'm not actually brave enough to try just anything, Commander. <>You're the one who's given me the courage to be with you like this... <>I hope...from now on, we can do our best together and try doing even more happy things, okay...?

TAC50|GAIN|I suppose my arrival means that I can try out all sorts of missions, Commander? Heheh, I can hardly wait.
TAC50|ALLHALLOWS|They say the voices of ghosts are a special kind of soundwave, so if we can synchronize with it, we might be able to speak with them.
M1014|DIALOGUE1|I feel very anxious every time I use the elevator here... It makes me very uncomfortable if it moves higher than 3.54 meters.
M1014|DIALOGUE2|I've finished preparing the conference documents. I went out of my way to encrypt them, so even if they get leaked... Eh? You can't read it? ...I think there's still enough time for you to learn how to decrypt it.
M1014|DIALOGUE3|These "wings"? Can I fly with them? Maybe, I think? I've never tried though, because I'm scared of heights.
M1014|SOULCONTRACT|This is what you called me out here for, Commander?<>Why didn't you tell me earlier? I would've made preparations first for something this important...<>Eh? I shouldn't overthink it? ...You're right. Maybe it is better to be simpler like this...❤
M1014|Introduce|Excuse me, are you the Commander? I didn't expect you to be this young; I thought you'd be the more older type... Ah, sorry, that was rude of me!
M1014|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, I've made plans for our next date based on the data from our previous one. Of course, I've also encrypted them... Hey! Why are you throwing it away!
M1014|GAIN|Excuse me, are you the Commander? I didn't expect you to be this young; I thought you'd be the more older type... Ah, sorry, that was rude of me!
M1014|NEWYEAR|I have investigated various New Year's customs, and I didn't realize there are so many of them. Why don't we give them all a try?
FP6|DIALOGUE1|It's so noisy outside. Did someone get into trouble? Hehe...seems like my new punishment game from yesterday will come in handy.
FP6|DIALOGUE2|Commander, the meeting should start soon once I finish this chocolate. Finish up the work you have on hand.
FP6|DIALOGUE3|Noticed my hairpin? This is the key to the handcuffs. Don't lose it.
FP6|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, in a sense, you really are guilty.<>It seems like these handcuffs will not be enough to detain you.<>Allow me to keep you here forever beside me with this vow...❤

AA12|DIALOGUE1|How do the other Dolls take care of their skin? I should ask on [Consultation Office] later tonight...
AA12|DIALOGUE2|It's so idiotic to use physical violence like a primitive being. An advanced Doll like myself should obviously solve problems in an advanced way.
AA12|DIALOGUE3|Hey, hey! Stop with the corporal punishment! I'm against violence!
AA12|SOULCONTRACT|Hah...I didn't think things would progress like this... What should I do?<>I should act more proper in a scenario like this, right? Let me think for a moment...<>Um...Commander...with me...together...I... Ahhh! Anyways, you understand what I mean!
AA12|Introduce|Hello, Commander, I'm AA-12. Pleased to meet... Blech! Trying to act all proper is making me sick.

AA12|GAIN|Hello, Commander, I'm AA-12. Pleased to meet... Blech! Trying to act all proper is making me sick.
PM06|DIALOGUE1|If only there were more red furniture in the dorm... Heheh, you hear that, Commander?
PM06|DIALOGUE2|It's boring to shoot at enemies that don't bleed. Just feels like a complete waste of bullets.
PM06|DIALOGUE3|Wanna go for a walk? Then you'll have to ask in the evening. I can't be in the sun at all.
PM06|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, can't it wait until later tonight? <>Whoa! Isn't this...?! Well, I guess there really is no delay for this kind of thing! <>Looks like we'll have to save some precious time this evening. Heheh!
PM06|Introduce|Oooooh! Is that your uniform? This mesmerizing red is just fabulous! I have a feeling we're gonna get along very well!

CETME556|DIALOGUE1|May I have a look at your battle plan, Commander? ...I see. So this is how far ahead you are...
CETME556|DIALOGUE2|556 and the others seem to be doing something really fun...N-No! This is time for work. I can't get distracted.
CETME556|DIALOGUE3|This box is exactly my size. It makes a good shield in combat and also comes in very handy when playing hide-and-seek.
CETME556|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, as a T-Doll, I have been relied on by many humans... <>But you are the only one I want to rely on. <>Now, could you please lend me your shoulder? ...Thank you for your cooperation.
CETME556|Introduce|Hello, you must be my Commander. Do you mind giving me a handshake? ...Thank you for your cooperation.
CETME556|DIALOGUEWEDDING|This is probably gonna be a busy day... Jeez. You'd better help me relax when I can finally catch some rest, Commander.
CETME556|GAIN|Hello, you must be my Commander. Do you mind giving me a handshake? ...Thank you for your cooperation.
OBR|DIALOGUE1|Could you give me two more days? I'll be getting my paycheck very soon... Ack, Commander! Nothing, just some weird prank call.
OBR|DIALOGUE2|So you're a T-Doll as well, Commander? I never noticed that befo... Who said that? It was Cino who told me.
OBR|DIALOGUE3|Alright, alright, I get it. Stop rushing me. Ouch, ouch, ouch...
OBR|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, I know that I have owed you many things. <>Your recognition and trust are treasures that I can never repay... <>If I must, I am willing to return your feelings with all that I have.
OBR|Introduce|Are you the Commander? I have the right person, right...? As long as I work hard, my debt will... Hmm? N-Nothing.

A91|DIALOGUE1|Huh? Didn't you just go out, Commander? I must have gotten the wrong person again~
A91|DIALOGUE2|If you want me to maintain my operational capability, then I'll need a minimum of 660ml of vodka per day.
A91|DIALOGUE3|My perfume's quite intense, so don't get too tipsy, okay?
A91|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, there's one thing you probably don't know yet... <>Although I'm usually flushed in the face, it's not always because I'm drunk. <>Sometimes, it's because there's someone in front of me who is more intoxicating than fine wine...
A91|Introduce|Hm? Let's see who's come to pick me up? ...One, two... Hehe, there sure are a lot of Commanders here.
A91|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I get tipsy if I'm by your side even when I'm not drinking... I guess vodka isn't as potent as you are.
A91|GAIN|Hm? Let's see who's come to pick me up? ...One, two... Hehe, there sure are a lot of Commanders here.
Cx4Storm|DIALOGUE1|It's actually pretty difficult to collect cigarette labels here, since nobody smokes...
Cx4Storm|DIALOGUE2|Commander, someone like you could have easily done well in another job, so why did you choose to work here?
Cx4Storm|DIALOGUE3|Wh-What is it, Commander? You seem worried.
Cx4Storm|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, thank you for bringing me all the way here. <>I used to doubt myself and often wondered if I would be better off elsewhere... <>But now I'm sure of it. I'll find the happiness I was looking for by your side!
Cx4Storm|Introduce|I'm sure of it, I'll be able to find my true self here! ...I'm Cx4 Storm, and I'll be in your care, Commander!
Cx4Storm|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, I don't quite understand this tactic. Help me practice it some more. I'm sure that with you around, I'll be able to carry on no matter how tough things get!
Cx4Storm|GAIN|I'm sure of it, I'll be able to find my true self here! ...I'm Cx4 Storm, and I'll be in your care, Commander!
M82A1|DIALOGUE1|A suggestion? Actually, I think... I'm sorry, I'd better not say it. I can't give you the answers you want...
M82A1|DIALOGUE2|Dolls cannot bear the prayers of mankind. We are not gods, and the only wishes Dolls can grant are their own.
M82A1|DIALOGUE3|There were once people who did whatever I told them... Yes, just like what you're doing to me now.
M82A1|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, how can you accept someone like me... <>All I can do is obey your orders and follow your guidance... Doesn't my selfishness hurt you? <>Maybe I can't give you the best answer, but when you can't bear it any more, please...let me be your pillar.
M82A1|Introduce|I'm M82A1... Commander, this is my name now. I am a Doll that belongs to you, and I will obey all the "guidance" you give me.
M82A1|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Coordination training? I can do it by myself, but if it's your order, then I can try it with everyone else.
M82A1|GAIN|I'm M82A1... Commander, this is my name now. I am a Doll that belongs to you, and I will obey all the "guidance" you give me.
Python|DIALOGUE1|You have a good eye for tactics. However, I'm sure you'll get a better view from my perspective.
Python|DIALOGUE2|Dolls don't normally possess the instinct for "terror" that humans do, but I'll make sure to teach everyone about it.
Python|DIALOGUE3|Please be careful, Commander. Some snakes might not be venomous, but they'll be all the more dangerous because of it.
Python|SOULCONTRACT|Hehe, Commander, have you finally abandoned your struggles? <>Once I set my eyes upon my "prey", they'll end up mine sooner or later. <>...Or perhaps, was I the one being drawn in by the bait all this while?
Python|Introduce|Commander, are you my new "prey"? Hehe, don't worry, I mean no disrespect.
Python|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, what sort of "prey" do you want to take next? Whatever you want is fine with me.
Python|GAIN|Commander, are you my new "prey"? Hehe, don't worry, I mean no disrespect.
M870P|DIALOGUE1|Stop embarrassing yourself~ If I were to enforce the law with your mediocre work efficiency, my shells wouldn't even be able to reach 300 km/h~
M870P|DIALOGUE2|If you were to go on Highway 666, you'd best prepare some soda, otherwise I can't guarantee safe travels for you... Pfff, did I scare you into wetting yourself?
M870P|DIALOGUE3|Tsk tsk, I can't just pretend I didn't see this assault on a police officer. I'll give you the choice of receiving a ticket or barking like a dog.
M870P|SOULCONTRACT|Pfff... Commander, is this a new way of getting out of traffic tickets? <>Since you put so much effort into it, I'll let you off with a verbal warning this time~ <>However, if I lock my eyes onto you, then you can forget about escaping arrest, hehe...
M870P|Introduce|Pff...are you the Commander? If the license pictures of the idiots on the road all looked as typical as you, I'd rather be hit by a speeding vehicle~
M870P|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, it looks like I'll have to watch you closely today. My neural cloud won't let a single moment of your idiocy escape me~ So you'd better give me a good show, okay?
M870P|GAIN|Pff...are you the Commander? If the license pictures of the idiots on the road all looked as typical as you, I'd rather be hit by a speeding vehicle~
AK74U|DIALOGUE1|If you have to say something, be quick about it. AS Val is waiting for me.
AK74U|DIALOGUE2|W-What are you trying to say? What's wrong with small ones?
AK74U|DIALOGUE3|Hey! My services don't include this sort of thing! If you want it, 9A-91 will be happy to oblige!
AK74U|SOULCONTRACT|Wait a minute, are you sure you got it right, Boss!? I've been mean to you all this time... Are you a masochist or something? No, stay away, I'm going to scream! I...I...okay, I'll let it slide, just this once... (trails off)
AK74U|Introduce|Ah, are you the Boss? My name's AK-74U. Think carefully about what services I can provide for your operations.
AK74U|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Looking to try me again today? Geez, it's not my fault if you get hurt again... Come, I'll loosen you up with my special massage.
AK74U|GAIN|Ah, are you the Boss? My name's AK-74U. Think carefully about what services I can provide for your operations.
Mk12|DIALOGUE1|My neural cloud needs to store things that are worth recalling, not just boring work records.
Mk12|DIALOGUE2|If you need to sacrifice me on a mission, then please arrange a thrilling end for me.
Mk12|DIALOGUE3|You keep barking orders, but I already know what to do, so quit nagging me already...
Mk12|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, do you understand the implications of me putting this on? <>In truth, I've always liked tragedies, because I've never been able to choose "happiness" before...<>So please order me to put this on...because I've been waiting all this time for such an "order."
Mk12|Introduce|Commander, if you're only going to give me boring orders, I'm not going to play along with them.
Mk12|DIALOGUEWEDDING|The operation documents? I was worried you'd nag me for them, so I prepared them ahead of time. Don't be in such a hurry to thank me, as there'll a lot more things you'll have to be grateful for in the future.
Mk12|GAIN|Commander, if you're only going to give me boring orders, I'm not going to play along with them.
FNSPR|DIALOGUE1|To me, the best part about being an adjutant is being able to openly observe you like this, Commander.
FNSPR|DIALOGUE2|Well, we can't always depend on your orders all the time since you've got so much to do. Sometimes, we need to rely on ourselves.
FNSPR|DIALOGUE3|Ahhh, don't touch my hat! it'll be troublesome if I gets exposed.
FNSPR|SOULCONTRACT|I didn't know that you were always looking at me too, Commander.<>Walk closer to me and don't be shy.<>Let's enjoy a world where only we exist in each others' eyes...
FNSPR|Introduce|Excuse me, Commander. I was observing you for three days and three nights before coming here, but that was just some personal investigation. I hope you don't mind.
FNSPR|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Don't worry, I won't be going anywhere. I'll always be watching you, heehee...
FNSPR|GAIN|Excuse me, Commander. I was observing you for three days and three nights before coming here, but that was just some personal investigation. I hope you don't mind.
Px4Storm|DIALOGUE1|If the company was more generous with its bonus plan, then I'm sure everyone would be more motivated. Wouldn't you agree, Mastermind?
Px4Storm|DIALOGUE2|Griffin work aside, I'd be glad to take on any odd jobs you have for me, Mastermind.
Px4Storm|DIALOGUE3|What? There's nothing that I want to buy, but don't you feel a sense of achievement when you watch your bank balance grow?
Px4Storm|SOULCONTRACT|After joining Griffin, I was expecting that under your command, I'd be able to complete some great job that nobody had ever done before... <>But I didn't expect that you'd even planned something like this out, Mastermind... <>It seems that whether it comes to plundering the enemy's fortunes or my neural cloud, you certainly cover all the angles.
Px4Storm|Introduce|Are you the Mastermind here? Ah, no...you're called the Commander here, right? Let's work together in future.
Px4Storm|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Mastermind, you need to tell me if you've got any plans. I can give you preferential treatment.
Px4Storm|GAIN|Are you the Mastermind here? Ah, no...you're called the Commander here, right? Let's work together in future.
JS9mm|DIALOGUE1|If you go to sleep early and wake up early, then all your problems will be easily solved.
JS9mm|DIALOGUE2|Oh no! I think I'm on cooking duty today... I-Is takeout okay?
JS9mm|DIALOGUE3|Commander, this isn't a good habit to have. You're just going to cause problems for others.
JS9mm|SOULCONTRACT|Commander... I-I'm not too used to stuff like this... <>As I thought...there's no way I'm getting out of this, right? <>Alright, I'll let you have your way just this once... ❤
JS9mm|Introduce|Commander, this is my first suggestion to you - please make sure the work you give me is within my abilities to accomplish. Thank you.
JS9mm|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Overtime again? Didn't we agree that you would rest earlier? Seriously, you never listen to what I tell you... I-I tried making some snacks, so you should take a short break.
JS9mm|GAIN|Commander, this is my first suggestion to you - please make sure the work you give me is within my abilities to accomplish. Thank you.
K11|DIALOGUE1|The reagent color doesn't look quite right...Commander? Nonono, you didn't see anything!
K11|DIALOGUE2|Hm...I think I should put a tank of oxygen in the first aid kit, not that I know what good it'll do.
K11|DIALOGUE3|Do you want to see an explosion? If you do, then touch me again like you did just now.
K11|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, why did you call me out at a time like this? I haven't finished my experimental notes yet...<>...I can't believe you would actually say something like that.<>It looks like in addition to experiments and missions, I'll have to make space in my neural cloud for our memories together.
K11|Introduce|Guess who this is, Commander of Griffin! I'm K11, an expert at handling emergencies. Please let me show you my full potential!
K11|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Do you want to take part in an outdoors survival game with me on our next vacation? It's okay if you don't know how to do it, I'll hold your hand and teach you.

Type88|DIALOGUE1|Uwah! What's this? Commander, why do you have that look on your face?
Type88|DIALOGUE2|I'd like to stay in a place without so many chores... I think I could spend all day in the workshop by myself.
Type88|DIALOGUE3|I wonder if I could join in conversations with everyone if I was more familiar with current topics...
Type88|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, I really don't get it... Why me... I don't know anything... I'm completely clueless... <>But with you by my side, I won't be afraid of the things I don't know anymore! <>Although...if I get scared by mundanely ordinary things again...please promise you won't laugh at me, okay?
Type88|Introduce|This is QJY-88 general purpose machine gun reporting, Commander. You don't...have anything scary hiding here, do you...

SAR21|DIALOGUE1|It looks like we have good weather as well today, and the insects look very healthy too, Commander.
SAR21|DIALOGUE2|Singapore? ...So you've heard of that name before. In that case, would you mind helping me build a model Merlion?
SAR21|DIALOGUE3|Eh? ...W-Wait! Don't just pick me up all of a sudden! Commander, I can tell you how much I weigh if you wanted to know!
SAR21|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, are you really choosing me... <>D-Don't talk nonsense! I'll say yes, because...because it's the most rational answer to give! <>I was just in the grip of my emotions for a bit... Really, just a little bit...
SAR21|Introduce|I am SAR-21, Commander. ...Where's your battle plan? It's not good to operate purely by instinct.

MP448|DIALOGUE1|I ended up disagreeing with big sis again during today's meeting... Commander, please be more brief with your words next time.
MP448|DIALOGUE2|I like pistols because they're simple, but exquisitely designed.
MP448|DIALOGUE3|Commander, if you have something to say then you should come out and say it. I have no idea what you're hinting at.
MP448|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, that serious look on your face is making me feel a little... <>But never mind that, what's important is that I understand what you're thinking. <>After all, our relationship and our feelings have always been that straightforward, haven't they?
MP448|Introduce|It is an honor to meet you, Commander. I hope my participation will make your victories simpler.

MP448|GAIN|It is an honor to meet you, Commander. I hope my participation will make your victories simpler.
Type03|DIALOGUE1|Commander, when you order an attack, it mustn't just be in terms of the operation. You also need to deal a telling blow to the enemy on a psychological level.
Type03|DIALOGUE2|I will take care to record your words, Commander, and if need be, I will gather everyone to learn from them. My mission is to carry out your will.
Type03|DIALOGUE3|Commander, is there something that I have not fully understood? I will take care to reflect on it.

Mk46|DIALOGUE3|I didn't expect your hands to be so soft, Commander, let me touch them some more.
Mk46|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, does it...have to be me? <>Honestly, you're never satisfied no matter how much effort I put in. <>Fine fine, I'll agree to anything as long as you're happy with it... ❤
Mk46|Introduce|So you're my new Commander, huh.... I don't like slaving away for someone I just met, but work's a different matter. Let's get along.
Mk46|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Still more work? Very well then, I wouldn't be able to escape anyway... Who let you keep such a tight rein on me?
Mk46|GAIN|So you're my new Commander, huh.... I don't like slaving away for someone I just met, but work's a different matter. Let's get along.
RT20|DIALOGUE1|No matter what it is, I'll be able to tell if it's real or fake with a bite.
RT20|DIALOGUE2|You're always so secretive, Commander, and I can never tell what you're going to do next. Could it be you're actually behind some huge scheme in the shadows?
RT20|DIALOGUE3|What's the matter? Want a bite? Hang on a bit...have you washed your hands?
RT20|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, am I an irreplaceable part of your plans? <>Although I've never been able to tell what you're planning or what secrets you're keeping... <>I'm sure this symbol of our oath is real and true.

M200|DIALOGUE3|...No, you don't need to praise me for something like this... Oh my, my head feels really hot...

Type62|DIALOGUE1|It seems like all the Dolls here are girls...although I do know of some Doll companies that use male Dolls as their unique selling point. Is this what's popular nowadays?
Type62|DIALOGUE2|Never in the science fiction films of the past would they have imagined that war in the future would be waged by a bunch of female robots with guns under a commander... Feels kinda lame, doesn't it?
Type62|DIALOGUE3|Uuwah you're so noisy! Don't you have anything else to do? Like some important work somewhere?
Type62|SOULCONTRACT|How are you feeling, Commander? ...Are you nervous?<>In the science fiction films of the past, humans and robots have always worked together to solve great problems.<>I think our story will be even more exciting than the movies.

Jericho|DIALOGUE2|I have to be strict, otherwise I won't be able to relax if I have to rely solely on a crazy little girl like Negev.
Jericho|DIALOGUE3|Are you quite done yet, Commander? Honestly, you're being terribly childish. I won't keep humoring you like this.
Jericho|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, we dolls only exist after we are granted "masks", and the range of emotions that we show had already been programmed beforehand.<>But you could see through that girl's "mask" and uncover her true nature...<>Commander, I'd like you to tell me the true story of the girl under that "mask"...
Jericho|Introduce|Are you the leader here? ...You don't look like it at all. Please act with more gravitas and don't take the position of Commander lightly.

M14Mod|DIALOGUE1|Commander, we went on many exciting adventures again. Would you like to hear about them?
M14Mod|DIALOGUE2|Are you having trouble with something? Times like these call for folk wisdom, so leave it to us!
M14Mod|DIALOGUE3|Commander, your way of greeting is a little too intense for us. We...still need time to get used to it...
M14Mod|GAIN|Commander, don't you think we've become a little more mature? Right now, we feel like we can do anything~

K31|DIALOGUE3|Commander, you've wasted quite a lot of my time already, so enjoy waiting for dinner tonight.
K31|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, both of us...should be ready for this, right? <>Was today's scenario orchestrated by you, or was it sheer coincidence? <>I don't know... but I understand that this moment was destined to occur...
K31|Introduce|Very good, this is just as planned. Meeting me now is the luckiest moment of your life, Commander.
K31|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, have you noticed any deviations in your biological clock recently? Don't worry, I'll help you adjust it.
P90|DIALOGUE1|Commander, do you know the latest slang nowadays? The memes change so fast that I can't keep up.
P90|DIALOGUE2|Just by changing my pitch a little, I can talk like this da nya~
P90|DIALOGUE3|"I-I'm not blushing! Don't get the wrong idea!" ...Hehe, is that what they call tsundere?
P90|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, do you want me to follow you forever?<>It's nothing tough for me as long as you don't mind me sticking so close to you...<>But you won't shake me off so easily, even if you run or fly away!
P90|Introduce|Huh? I was just following the other Dolls around... How did I end up here? ...Ah~ Hello! Do you know where this place is?
P90|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Everyone likes you, Commander, but my love for you isn't just a trend, you know? There's nothing quite like how I love you~
P90|CHRISTMAS|I feel sorry for people who dress up as Santa, because everyone's asleep when they're giving out presents and nobody will see what they look like.
TEC9|GAIN|I came here because I heard you could do work without coming into contact with humans... W-Wait a minute! Are you human?
TEC9|DIALOGUE1|When I think about how humans look just like Dolls but with all kinds of organs and blood inside them instead... Oh heavens, I'm losing my mind just thinking about it!
TEC9|DIALOGUE2|The "organization" where I previously worked had me using knives, but I ran away in the end because I couldn't do anything to the humans...
TEC9|DIALOGUE3|Commander, could you keep a safe distance from me? ...Yeah, at least ten meters.
TEC9|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Th-This is so scary... I can't believe you have blood vessels in your eyes, Commander! Didn't I tell you to get some rest? You're making me very uncomfortable...
TEC9|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, to tell you the truth, I'm not really interested in humans... <>But you're a special case, because I get very concerned if you get hurt or if you get tired... <>Do you worry about me the same way too?
P22|DIALOGUE1|Like I was saying about the Commander's tactic... Hm? Is something the matter, Commander? Oh, I wasn't talking to you, don't mind me.
P22|DIALOGUE2|Commander, exactly how much do you know about yourself? We might be more alien to ourselves than we think.
P22|DIALOGUE3|Are you really so frustrated without a conversation partner? ...Alright then, what do you want to talk about?
P22|SOULCONTRACT|I think the Commander looks strange... What do you think? <>Mhm, he does look a little different, but I think I know what this is all about.<>However, the answer will have to wait until I put this on, okay? Hee hee~
P22|Introduce|Oh my, the Commander's come to pick me up, we'll talk another time. Greetings, Commander. My name is P22. Do you need help with anything?
P22|DIALOGUEWEDDING|When there's nothing we can talk about, I can always talk about you, Commander. Hehe, I'll never get tired of discussing about you, Commander.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
HS2000|DIALOGUE1|I like the sound of heartbeats... I envy those things which humans have, and which Dolls don't.
HS2000|DIALOGUE2|I only realized it after coming here, but it's not just medical science that can protect others. You can do that by picking up a weapon too.
HS2000|DIALOGUE3|Are you feeling unwell, Commander? Would you like me to shock you with my defibrillator?
HS2000|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, your heart seems to be beating faster than usual... <>Does this mean you're being sincere? A person's heart doesn't lie. <>Funny...I feel like...my heart's pounding too...
HS2000|Introduce|I see, so that's your heartbeat, Commander... Yes, I'll make sure to remember it. I'll be in your care from now on.
HS2000|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I remember your heartbeat in all kinds of situations, Commander - when you're working, when you're happy, when you're sleeping...but your heartbeat when you're happy sounds best.
X95|DIALOGUE1|Flowers only have meaning when people appreciate them or when they wither away. Commander, I'm willing to endure any kind of suffering as long as I can bloom for everyone.
X95|DIALOGUE2|Jericho might be a little harsh, but I understand where her kindness lies... Commander, please place your trust in her.
X95|DIALOGUE3|Is there something bothering you? Take your time and tell me. I'm here for you. 
X95|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, I've always worked hard for everyone and haven't thought much about myself... <>Yet you've accompanied me from the beginning and even shared my pain. <>Commander, you might be the only one who can save me...so please...become my final pillar of support.
X95|Introduce|This is wonderful, Commander, we meet at last. I, X95, will give everything I have for you... No, not just for you, for everyone.
X95|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, there's no need to bother you with such a small matter, right? I'll handle it by my... Ah// in that case, thank you for your kindness, hehe.
KSVK|DIALOGUE1|I will quietly await your orders here, Commander. Make your choice.
KSVK|DIALOGUE2|We stand in the center of the vortex of the world, Commander. Take care not to lose yourself in it.
KSVK|DIALOGUE3|I cannot answer all of your questions. Some answers can only be understood on your own.
KSVK|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, I no longer see any confusion in your eyes. <>The time is ripe, and you are the sole truth within my heart... <>Oh oathsworn one, let us carve an eternal existence into each others' fates...
KSVK|Introduce|Oh Commander, who has been chosen by destiny, I shall witness your path, so please prepare yourself!
KSVK|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Oh oathsworn one, cherish this present time, for this present happiness was not easily won, and I...can no longer bear to be without you.
Lewis|DIALOGUE1|I lost all the material I prepared for the meeting...b-but it's okay! I memorized it all!
Lewis|DIALOGUE2|Everyone looks so adorable, I can't believe they're all Tactical Dolls! Are you trying to deceive the enemy?
Lewis|DIALOGUE3|Hm? You want to arm-wrestle with me, Commander? I'm very good at it, you know.
Lewis|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, while you're the person I'm most familiar with, there are times when you seem like such a stranger... <>I can't bear to just gaze at you from afar, I want to enter your heart. <>I...I want to know everything about you.
Lewis|Introduce|Thank goodness~ The Commander here looks like a nice person! I'm Lewis, pleased to meet you!
Lewis|DIALOGUEWEDDING|No matter how tired or unhappy I am, I perk up right away when I see you, Commander! Hehe~
UKM2000|DIALOGUE1|I escaped to this planet because of "them"... You don't need to know the details, Commander. It'll do you no good.
UKM2000|DIALOGUE2|Cats speak in a language that's very close to our mother tongue, so there are times when I can understand their thoughts.
UKM2000|DIALOGUE3|Don't pull down my hood! What if "they" recognize me...!
UKM2000|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, is this a good idea? I feel like I'm still keeping a lot of things from you... <>S-So you mean, you don't mind being with me, even if my planet invades the Earth? <>...Thank you, Commander... In that case, for the sake of this promise, I'm also willing to face any future with you!
UKM2000|Introduce|Are you...the Commander? It looks like I have no choice but to work with you from now on. "They" shouldn't be able to find me as long as I'm here...
UKM2000|DIALOGUEWEDDING|A cat jumped out of nowhere in the dorms...it scared me half to death... Commander, if "they" find me, you'll have to protect me well.
scout|DIALOGUE1|A pet? How rude, Mitsuha is my...avian guardian...I guess?
scout|DIALOGUE2|Huh? When did they change the mission? ...Apologies, I was too focused on the documents during the meeting, and I guess I missed your announcement.
scout|DIALOGUE3|Commander, you mustn't take action before you understand what you're looking at.
scout|SOULCONTRACT|Commander, I think I'm beginning to understand why Mitsuha likes you so much. <>I often find myself overlooking a lot of things because I keep looking at you because you keep drawing my attention when I least expect it... <>Will you keep looking at me too? Keep me in your eyes...and never look away.
scout|Introduce|Mitsuha, are you sure this is the one? ...What a surprise, I didn't expect someone to actually gain Mitsuha's approval. It looks like you're not an ordinary person, Commander.
scout|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, please don't stand beside me while I'm working, otherwise I'll only be able to think of you...b-but don't go too far away either.
Falcon|DIALOGUE1|I think I broke something again just now... Huh? What did you just say, Little Lamb...? A lack of talent? Haha, who are you talking about, dummy.
Falcon|DIALOGUE2|Well, it IS a musical instrument famous in my hometown. I can make a guitar like that too, and I can even teach you for free! ...Hmph, you're awfully lazy, Little Lamb. In that case, you can just watch me make it.
Falcon|DIALOGUE3|There sure are a lot of people from my hometown here... Personally, I'd prefer to lie on the grass and look at the sky by myself. But if it's you, Little Lamb, I'll let you lie beside me.
Falcon|SOULCONTRACT|Little Lamb, i-is that ring in your hand really for me? <>Why is it that you keep doing things that my instincts can't keep up with? It's so unfair... <>I love it! You'll always be the person I love most, Little Lamb...
Falcon|Introduce|Ahoj! Little Lamb...ah, no, I mean, Commander! It's a pleasure to meet you. You can call me Falcon.
Falcon|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Uwah! No peeking at the musical scores inside my drawer! They're all love songs I wrote for you... I'll play them for you when the anniversary comes, but it's too embarrassing to take them out now!
Magal|DIALOGUE1|I heard someone humming at the practice range. What? You mean you can't hear it, Commander? I'm sorry, it seems like I overestimated the extent of human hearing.
Magal|DIALOGUE2|You're asking about my headphones? They're used to filter out noise. I can't concentrate when my surroundings are too noisy...so please stop chattering on with useless things.
Magal|DIALOGUE3|Your hand feels very comfortable, and it puts me at ease...but that doesn't give you a reason to touch me at work.
Magal|SOULCONTRACT|It looks like you went out of your way to pick a quiet location. So, what do you want to tell me, Commander? <>...Is that so? How could I refuse someone who can discuss the world of touch and hearing with me? <>In that case, let's experience that world together. Thank you.
Magal|Introduce|Greetings, Commander. Your heartbeat sounds stable, which is a good thing.
Magal|DIALOGUEWEDDING|I can hear your heart beating, Commander. You don't need to approach me from the rear, by which I mean, hugging me from the front would be good too, right?
PM9|DIALOGUE1|Commander? Being picky about food isn't a good habit. Don't you think it's a little sad that you can't eat spicy stuff?
PM9|DIALOGUE2|I hear there are many Dolls on the base who are skilled in melee combat. I'd like to challenge them if possible. After all...there can only be one champion.
PM9|DIALOGUE3|C-Commander, you're too close... Hey, you can't just kabedon me - get lost! You're squashing my hair! Get lost!
PM9|SOULCONTRACT|Hah? Are you serious, Commander? <>Well...it's not like you can't... <>You're being unfair. From now on, I'm going to give you just as much of my feelings too.
PM9|Introduce|Huh, are you my new superior? Remember my name, I'm PM-9 submachine gun!
PM9|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Huh? How come you've been able to catch my punches lately, Commander? Yet when I use the hand that's not wearing the ring, you can't catch them... Why is that?
Jill|DIALOGUE1|I told you before to call me Jill... Just Jill. I'll pour a Sugar Rush on your head if you dare call me by "that" name.
Jill|DIALOGUE2|Hey, Commander, want a drink? I think I should be able to mix something that'll cheer you up.
Jill|DIALOGUE3|Do you need some personal space, Fore? I don't mind staying here ~nya... Ahem, Commander, forget what you saw and heard just now... I was just practicing my ventriloquism, that's all.
Jill|SOULCONTRACT|W-Wait!? This is...for me?<>Trying to escape from your bar tab with this isn't funny at all... <>Alright alright, I get it. In any case...I still got a bar to run, you know, so start by topping up my fridge with beer.
Jill|Introduce|Hey, call me Jill, Boss... You know what, can I just call you Commander?
Jill|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Alright, enough with making me guess what sort of drinking game you want to play. Do you want to play truth or dare? I'll do anything besides petting a dog. ...Are you serious? "The person I like the most" is such an obvious question... Are you really going to waste a chance to get an honest answer out of me?
Jill|GAIN|Hey, call me Jill, Boss... You know what, can I just call you Commander?
SEI|DIALOGUE1|I long to help people, just as people have helped me. When I see you, Commander, I realize that there are others who like to stick their noses into things just like I do, which makes me very happy.
SEI|DIALOGUE2|The White Knights helmet is just too comfortable, to the point that I often forget it's still on my head... Have you had an experience like that before, Commander? Like looking for the glasses on your nose or a key that's already in the lock?
SEI|DIALOGUE3|Whether it's being a White Knight, Stella's bodyguard, or a Griffin employee...I haven't been able to get away from violent conflicts at all. Maybe this is my life.
SEI|SOULCONTRACT|Is this...uhm, is this for me? But, uhm, what will Stella think...?<>Aw, honestly... I'm just no good with this kind of thing. <>Commander, please consider this carefully. If you truly mean it, then I'll give you everything I have...
SEI|Introduce|Master Specialist, Sei P. Asagiri of the 765th Division Valkyrie Corps, at your service!
SEI|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Ever since that time, I keep recalling the embarrassing things you said to me every time I see you, Commander. Ah, but I was very happy to hear those words, of course! <>How shall I put this... I've always felt that I often say the wrong things by accident and make people upset... <>Yet, you're able to accept all of my faults and accomplish our goals together... I'm really happy that I met you.
SEI|GAIN|Master Specialist, Sei P. Asagiri of the 765th Division Valkyrie Corps, at your service!
Dorothy|DIALOGUE1|I'm pretty good at face reading. Let me guess, you've probably been through a lot, Commander. Yet, you still enjoy butting into other people's business, and so you'll wind up into even more trouble in the future... So, would you like Dorothy to comfort you? Hm?
Dorothy|DIALOGUE2|How do you feel about being called "Commander"? Addressing you as Senpai, Master, Babe, or Darling will cost you extra.
Dorothy|DIALOGUE3|What kind of role do you want me to play, Commander? Do you want me to act more innocent to match my appearance, or are you okay with me as I've always been?
Dorothy|SOULCONTRACT|Is this ring...for me? Commander, you...? This is making me feel like my heart has been infected by a Trojan virus... <>Pl-Please let me think about this... Dorothy belongs to everyone, after all, and if I become yours and yours only... <>Perhaps...that wouldn't be so bad. From now on, I will only provide my services to you.
Dorothy|Introduce|I'm Dorothy, the cutest of them all. Everybody needs me, and Dorothy belongs to everybody!
Dorothy|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Who am I? Why was I made? Are the feelings in my mind real, or are they simply ordinary electrical signals? All of my doubts are gone now. Did you really have to monopolize me, you greedy villain? Well then, come on!
Dorothy|GAIN|I'm Dorothy, the cutest of them all. Everybody needs me, and Dorothy belongs to everybody!
Stella|DIALOGUE1|I believe leaders are very important. A good leader can accomplish things with exceptional efficiency, but few people understand that. Many are only concerned with taking advantage of the situation without putting any effort in.
Stella|DIALOGUE2|These cat ears? They're not on my head because I want them to be, but I don't dislike them. I wouldn't mind if you want to try touching them... Wait, someone's coming!
Stella|DIALOGUE3|Sei is my most important friend...or maybe even more than just a friend. I believe that she'll be safe and happy working under you...or at the very least, she'll be happy.
Stella|SOULCONTRACT|This looks quite well made. So, who's the Lilim...I mean, the Tactical Doll you're forming an oath with? <>Me? You really do have a wild imagination, but I wouldn't say this is a bad idea.<>Then, let Sei and I accompany you along your path. Now, help me put it on.
Stella|Introduce|Stella Hoshii, that's my name. Alright, introductions are over. Now get me something to wake me up before we start work.
Stella|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Is your work still not done yet? Well, it indeed has been a busy day, so I'll lend you a hand. In return, I get to dictate the rest of your free time.
Stella|GAIN|Stella Hoshii, that's my name. Alright, introductions are over. Now get me something to wake me up before we start work.
Alma|DIALOGUE1|The feeling of working here...is really quite novel. I don't usually meet my clients face to face, but since my client is the Commander of Griffin, and you're my most special client...
Alma|DIALOGUE2|Hey, where are you staring at? Commander? Comms Expander? Forget it, I don't care, but these aren't fake. I'm very proud of them, and why shouldn't I be? They're filled to the brim with love and dreams.
Alma|DIALOGUE3|You mean "those" photos? Have you forgotten that I'm a hacker? With a few simple keystrokes, your adorable sleeping face will be "accidentally" plastered all over Griffin Anonymous Message Board. Very well, I'll take an interesting story as your peace of mind fee.
Alma|SOULCONTRACT|Uhm, huh? This isn't a joke, is it?<>But if it's you, then maybe I... <>I'm terribly sorry for the hesitation. My answer is "yes", of course! I'd say that even if we weren't on the kiss cam!
Alma|Introduce|Greetings, Commander of Griffin, I am Alma. Hah, as I thought, I need to give a textbook self-introduction here too.
Alma|DIALOGUEWEDDING|It feels really good to have someone by my side... I think I understand you very well now, and the fact that I haven't broken up with you yet is really quite remarkable. Please continue to be my pillow. Otherwise, I won't be able to sleep if I don't hear your heartbeat.
Alma|GAIN|Greetings, Commander of Griffin, I am Alma. Hah, as I thought, I need to give a textbook self-introduction here too.
Dana|DIALOGUE1|Don't ask me about that sort of thing. I don't plan and evaluate every move I make.
Dana|DIALOGUE2|Are you free, Commander? I need some suggestions on how to get a blockage unstuck.
Dana|DIALOGUE3|You look like you need some more rest... Want a tender hug? Let me know if you want it, Commander. That's what friends are for.
Dana|SOULCONTRACT|Huh? So this is what you wanted to say after going around in circles for so long? <>Since you need me by your side, I'll have you become mine from now on. <>I'll take responsibility for protecting you, and I won't let you come to any harm. <>However, Jill won't be able to keep her head on straight once she learns of this, so make sure to buy her some expensive alcohol later.
Dana|Introduce|Just call me Dana, Commander. I don't quite understand your work, but let me know if I can help out in any way.
Dana|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Want to see the world once you're less busy? There are a few places on Earth that you shouldn't visit alone, like Iceland, Finland, or Panama... Which do you think should be our first stop?
Dana|GAIN|Just call me Dana, Commander. I don't quite understand your work, but let me know if I can help out in any way.
ASVALMod|SOULCONTRACT|Huh? You...me...? My bear... Uh, no... Nothing!<>In any case, thank you so much for your acknowledgment! I'll try my best to live up to your expectations, Commander!
ASVALMod|ALLHALLOWS|Halloween...isn't really my thing...
G36Mod|SOULCONTRACT|I have only been able to give my all because you need me, Master.<>From now on, please let me stay by your side as your bespoke maid.
G36Mod|Introduce|Guten tag. I will exclusively serve as your maid from now on, master.
G36Mod|ALLHALLOWS|Commander, you shouldn't spoil everyone so much. You've given out too much candy tonight. They might not be able to go into battle if they get cavities.
G36Mod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|It's going to be another busy day today, yet you're the only one that knows how hardworking I am... So, is there anything you'd like me to get for you? I'll continue to keep this a secret from everyone.
LWMMGMod|SOULCONTRACT|Is this...prepared for me? Isn't this a bit too extravagant?<>...But I'll let you have your way this time.<>I've occasionally fantasized about this scenario before, but I've never thought it would become reality...<>I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart, Commander...
LWMMGMod|Introduce|Pleased to meet you, Commander. There is...no need to introduce me to the others. I'm fine working alone...
LWMMGMod|ALLHALLOWS|I didn't expect Halloween to be this busy. Everyone! You'd better not throw out the packaging for the candies! You can reuse them for many other purposes!
LWMMGMod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, I booked us dinner at a good restaurant this weekend. You've worked hard this week, so I'll splurge a little on you.
LWMMGMod|NEWYEAR|Happy New Year, Commander. The finance report for the previous year is out. There wasn't too much wastage, so please keep up the good work for this year.
M14Mod|SOULCONTRACT|This day is finally here, Commander.<>I've always wondered when you would notice me...<>This is the happiest of my entire life!
M14Mod|Introduce|Commander, I will not let you down!
M14Mod|ALLHALLOWS|It's a trick for you~ Heheh! ...You'd have been fine if you had given me candy.
M14Mod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, Commander! Wanna hear a joke? It's a bit embarrassing, but...you're used to it, right? Heheh...
M14Mod|CHRISTMAS|Merry Christmas! Santa Claus is coming, right? RIGHT?
MicroUZIMod|SOULCONTRACT|Why did you give me something like this out of nowhere! Idiot, don't make me shoot you!<>I... This sort of thing...<>Alright, I don't particularly dislike you, so I'll look after you...
StenMK2Mod|SOULCONTRACT|Eh? My feelings...are answered?<>For someone like me without any strong points, I thought that this day would never come.<>It's the first time I've felt so happy.
StenMK2Mod|Introduce|You are the rumored Commander, right? Nice to meet you.
StenMK2Mod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, don't go to the cafeteria after work today. I've prepared some desserts for you... Hehe, I have to show off my skills once in a while!
STG44Mod|SOULCONTRACT|Eh! Commander, why are you so close?<>Uh, I don't dislike you, but...what...?! Really?! I've always been bothering you so much...<>Then...can I scoot a little closer to you?
STG44Mod|DIALOGUEWEDDING|Commander, even if you have a lot of work, don't slack on your appearance! Come, let me fix you up.
K31|GAIN|Very good, this is just as planned. Meeting me now is the luckiest moment of your life, Commander.
P90|GAIN|Huh? I was just following the other Dolls around... How did I end up here? ...Ah~ Hello! Do you know where this place is?
TEC9|Introduce|I came here because I heard you could do work without coming into contact with humans... W-Wait a minute! Are you human?
P22|GAIN|Oh my, the Commander's come to pick me up, we'll talk another time. Greetings, Commander. My name is P22. Do you need help with anything?
HS2000|GAIN|I see, so that's your heartbeat, Commander... Yes, I'll make sure to remember it. I'll be in your care from now on.
X95|GAIN|This is wonderful, Commander, we meet at last. I, X95, will give everything I have for you… No, not just for you, for everyone.
KSVK|GAIN|Oh Commander, who has been chosen by destiny, I shall witness your path, so please prepare yourself!
Lewis|GAIN|Thank goodness~ The Commander here looks like a nice person! I'm Lewis, pleased to meet you!
UKM2000|GAIN|Are you...the Commander? It looks like I have no choice but to work with you from now on. "They" shouldn't be able to find me as long as I'm here...
scout|GAIN|Mitsuha, are you sure this is the one? ...What a surprise, I didn't expect someone to actually gain Mitsuha's approval. It looks like you're not an ordinary person, Commander.
Falcon|GAIN|Ahoj! Little Lamb...ah, no, I mean, Commander! It's a pleasure to meet you. You can call me Falcon.
Magal|GAIN|Greetings, Commander. Your heartbeat sounds stable, which is a good thing.
PM9|GAIN|Huh, are you my new superior? Remember my name, I'm PM-9 submachine gun!
K11_0|Introduce|Guess who this is, Commander of Griffin! I'm K11, an expert at handling emergencies. Please let me show you my full potential!
K11_0|GAIN|Guess who this is, Commander of Griffin! I'm K11, an expert at handling emergencies. Please let me show you my full potential!

UMP45_0|GAIN|UMP45 has arrived. Commander, let's get along from now on~
UMP9_0|Introduce|UMP9 has come home! Everybody, we're family now!
UMP9_0|GAIN|UMP9 has come home! Everybody, we're family now!
KSVK_0|Introduce|Oh Commander, who has been chosen by destiny, I shall witness your path, so please prepare yourself!
KSVK_0|GAIN|Oh Commander, who has been chosen by destiny, I shall witness your path, so please prepare yourself!

OC44_0|GAIN|I finally get to meet you, Commander!~ I'm OTs-44, may I stay here with you?
HK416_0|HELLO|Good morning, Commander. I won't lose to anyone today.
